  These tests involve a library which has the 'test' scope, meaning it should only be available at

  compile time!) by using Class.forName().

  A binary is configured to also check for the existence of the class at runtime. The binary should
  compile (because the reference to the 'test' class is dynamic and thus not checked by javac), but
  not run (because the binary should not have access to 'test' scopes any time).
