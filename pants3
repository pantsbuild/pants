# Set interpreter constraints to exactly match the interpreter used for the venv.
# Note that $PY only impacts which virtualenv we use for the parent Pants process; we must also set
# PANTS_PYTHON_SETUP_INTERPRETER_CONSTRAINTS to constrain spawned subprocesses such as tests. Without
# any interpreter constraints, we get the _Py_Dealloc exception (#6985) as Pants will try to use Python 2
# for subprocesses. Without the exact constraints we set, we could end up using a different Python 3
# minor version for subprocesses than we do for Pants.
