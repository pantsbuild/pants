# Pants Build System

Pants is a build system for software projects in a variety of languages.
It works particularly well for a source code repository that contains
many distinct projects.

Friendly documentation: http://pantsbuild.github.io/

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to verify the build
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pantsbuild/pants.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pantsbuild/pants/branches)

And [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) to monitor test coverage
