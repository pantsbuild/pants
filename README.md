# Pants Build System

Pants is a scalable build system for _monorepos_: codebases containing 
multiple projects, often using multiple programming languages and frameworks, 
in a single unified code repository.

Some noteworthy features include:

* Explicit dependency modeling.
* Fine-grained invalidation.
* Shared result caching.
* Concurrent execution.
* Remote execution.
* Unified interface for multiple tools and languages.
* Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API.

We release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/pypi)

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to verify the build

# Requirements

To run Pants, you need:

* Linux or macOS.
* Python 3.7+ discoverable on your `PATH`.
* A C compiler, system headers and Python headers (to compile native Python modules).
* Internet access (so that Pants can fully bootstrap itself).
