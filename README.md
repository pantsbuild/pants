# Pants Build System

Pants is a scalable build system for _monorepos_: codebases containing 
multiple projects, often using multiple programming languages and frameworks, 
in a single unified code repository.

Some noteworthy features include:

* Explicit dependency modeling.
* Fine-grained invalidation.
* Shared result caching.
* Concurrent execution.
* Remote execution.
* Unified interface for multiple tools and languages.
* Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API.
