        We'd love to use your company's logo on the Users Page!

        By attaching it here, permission is granted to display this logo on pantsbuild.org 
        in affirmation that the organization uses Pants. No other usage rights are granted to 
        the organization's intellectual property. Please ensure that you have the right to 
        grant us permission to use the logo in this manner before adding it. 

        If you're unsure, please submit this page without the logo, and we can revisit it later,
        if/when permission has been established. The other information is still very helpful!
      placeholder: Drag and drop a .jpg or .png image of your company logo into this box.
