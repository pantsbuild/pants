        We'd love to use your company's logo on the Users Page!

        Please ensure that you have the right to grant us permission to use the logo in
        this manner before adding it.

        If you're unsure, please submit this page without the logo, and we can revisit it later,
        if/when permission has been established. The other information is still very helpful!
      placeholder: Drag and drop a .jpg or .png image of your company logo into this box.
