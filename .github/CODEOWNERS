# This file is used by GitHub to assign reviewers to PRs when PRs are opened in this repo.
# More information: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# We use this file not to assign _ownership_ but to ensure that PR creators don't need to know who
# "the right person" is to add to PR. Instead the "owners" here are more "who knows enough about
# this code to review it, or add the right reviewers".
#
# This list isn't static either. Anyone can make a PR that edits this file to add/remove themselves
# from any number of entries. Additionally, this list may not be exhaustive, there might be
# files/directories that don't (yet) have owners.
