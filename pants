# This bootstrap script runs pants from the live sources in this repo.
#
# Further support is added for projects wrapping pants with custom external extensions.  In the
# future this will work differently (see: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/5), but
# currently pants extenders can invoke this script exporting a few environment variables to include
# the extension source and requirements for development purposes:
# WRAPPER_SRCPATH       This is a colon separated list of paths containing extension sourcecode.
# WRAPPER_REQUIREMENTS  This is a colon separated list of pip install compatible requirements.txt
#                       files.
#
# For example, with a wrapping project layed out like so:
# /src/wrapper/
#   src/main/python/
#     wrapper/
#       ...
#   dependencies/python/
#     BUILD
#     requirements.txt
#
# And a pantsbuild/pants clone like so:
# /src/pantsbuild-pants
#
# You could invoke pants in the wrapper with its custom extension enabled using a script like so:
# /src/wrapper/pants
# ==
# #!/usr/bin/env bash
# WRAPPER_REQUIREMENTS="/src/wrapper/dependencies/python/requirements.txt" \
# WRAPPER_SRCPATH=/src/wrapper/src/main/python \
#    exec /src/pantsbuild-pants/pants "$@"
#
# The script defaults to running with Python 3. To use a specific Python version,
# such as 3.7, prefix the script with `PY=python3.7`.
