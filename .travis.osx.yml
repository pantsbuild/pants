# Setting the language to objective-c is the magic to get an OSX slave
# assigned by Travis CI.
# Its not clearly spelled out, but the relevant bits are documented here:
#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/objective-c/
#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/
#
# NB: Travis-CI does have support for an os list in the main .travis.yml
# and this would be preferrable, but they are currently under capacity
# on osx slaves and not accepting new users:

  # The https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants-for-travis-osx-ci repo this CI runs for is force
  # pushed to asynchronously by https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants CI jobs.  With multiple
  # shards in play for the OSX ci we often get into situations where later-scheduled shards
  # try to check out the repo and fail since the sha they are looking for has since been
  # eradicated by a force push from the https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants CI job when changes
  # are landing on master quickly.  We fail-fast here to not belabor the point and allow the next
  # green OSX CI to happen more quickly.
