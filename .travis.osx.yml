# Setting the language to objective-c is the magic to get an OSX slave
# assigned by Travis CI.
# Its not clearly spelled out, but the relevant bits are documented here:
#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/objective-c/
#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/
#
# NB: Travis-CI does have support for an os list in the main .travis.yml
# and this would be preferrable, but they are currently under capacity
# on osx slaves and not accepting new users:

language: objective-c

script: |
  sw_vers
  python --version
  java -version

# The `notifications:` configuration will be programatically copied over from `.travis.yml` for
# central maintenance of distribution lists, see: `build-support/bin/ci-sync.sh`.
