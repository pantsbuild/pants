A subset of the Maintainers takes responsibility for publishing these releases.\n\nWe use a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/0/embed?src=hvd8qnf6fnp5klnk7u46q1noeo@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) to coordinate who is on release duty in a given week. When it is time for a release, the Maintainer who has release duty that week is responsible for updating the release documentation, creating release builds, and shepherding them through the review and [release process](doc:release-process)."

Maintainer candidates are nominated by existing maintainers from among the wider contributor base. Criteria for nomination include:

- The candidate's desire to become a maintainer.
- A track record of good contributions.
- A friendly, helpful, positive attitude.

If a contributor has been nominated, and is willing to become a maintainer, then their candidacy will be discussed and voted on by the existing maintainers.
