The [Pants community](doc:the-pants-community) is friendly, welcoming, and passionate about improving the craft of software engineering. If you need help with anything Pants-related, you've come to the right place.  We'd love to hear from you!

Discussions
----

The best place to ask technical questions or hold design discussions is via the project's [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants). While questions, feedback, and design discussions are equally welcome on Slack, *we encourage you to choose Discussions whenever it's likely other users would benefit from persistent access to the conversation*. GitHub Discussions is indexed by search engines, and its content is retained long-term, so this is opportunity to help your fellow Pants users by making it easier for folks to discover supplementary technical information beyond the [docs](https://pantsbuild.org/docs).

We encourage you to introduce yourself in the [`"welcome"`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/categories/-welcome) category!


Community Chat
-----

The best place to become acquainted with Pants community members and exchange informal chat is at the project's Slack. You can join using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9zgf-MXRnVDJbrVEST3urqneq7LCcy0zw8qU-GH4hPMn52A/viewform?usp=sf_link). *We use Slack's basic tier, which expires messages after a couple months, so usage is best suited to the more ephemeral or informal conversations that are unlikely to have long-term archival value.*

We encourage you to introduce yourself in the `#welcome` channel!


Blog
----

Read [blog.pantsbuild.org](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/) to find elaboration on new features, tutorials, reveals of upcoming features, insights into what we're thinking about and working on, case studies, and behind-the-scenes interviews with Pants users and maintainers.
