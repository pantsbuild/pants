The best place to get help is the Pants project's Slack workspace. You can join using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9zgf-MXRnVDJbrVEST3urqneq7LCcy0zw8qU-GH4hPMn52A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

We encourage you to introduce yourself in `#welcome`. You can use `#general` to ask questions or to share feedback.
