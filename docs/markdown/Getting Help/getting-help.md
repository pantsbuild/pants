The [Pants community](doc:the-pants-community) is friendly, welcoming, and passionate about improving the craft of software engineering. If you need help with anything Pants-related, you've come to the right place.  We'd love to hear from you!

Community Chat
-----

The best place to become acquainted with Pants community members and exchange informal chat is at the project's Slack. You can join using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9zgf-MXRnVDJbrVEST3urqneq7LCcy0zw8qU-GH4hPMn52A/viewform?usp=sf_link). We encourage you to introduce yourself in the `#welcome` channel!

The primary public channels of community chat also have a [searchable public archive](https://chat.pantsbuild.org/). If you suspect your question has been asked before, the archive is the fastest way to find an answer. No login is required.


Blog

Read [blog.pantsbuild.org](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/) to find elaboration on new features, tutorials, reveals of upcoming features, insights into what we're thinking about and working on, case studies, and behind-the-scenes interviews with Pants users and maintainers.


Mailing list
