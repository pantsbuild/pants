Pants commands are known as _goals_, such as `test` and `lint`.

To see the current list of goals, run:

```bash
❯ ./pants help goals
```

You'll see more goals activated as you activate more [backends](doc:enabling-backends).

# Running goals

For example:

```bash
❯ ./pants test project/app_test.py
15:40:37.89 [INFO] Completed: test - project/app_test.py:tests succeeded.

✓ project/app_test.py:tests succeeded.
```

You can also run multiple goals in a single run of Pants, in which case they will run sequentially:

```bash
# Format all code, and then lint it:
❯ ./pants fmt lint ::
```

Finally, Pants supports running goals in a `--loop`: in this mode, all goals specified will run sequentially, and then Pants will wait until a relevant file has changed to try running them again.

```bash
# Re-run typechecking and testing continuously as files or their dependencies change:
❯ ./pants --loop check test project/app_test.py
```

Use `Ctrl+C` to exit the `--loop`.

# Goal arguments

Some simple goals—such as the `roots` goal—do not require arguments. But most goals require some arguments to work on. 

For example, to run the `count-loc` goal, which counts lines of code in your repository, you need to provide a set of files and/or targets to run on:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "$ ./pants count-loc '**'\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLanguage                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPython                      13       155       50        22       83          5\nBASH                         2       261       29        22      210         10\nJSON                         2        25        0         0       25          0\nPlain Text                   2        43        1         0       42          0\nTOML                         2        65       14        18       33          0\n...",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "Shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Quoting file patterns",
  "body": "Note the single-quotes around the file pattern `'**'`. This is so that your shell doesn't attempt to expand the pattern, but instead passes it unaltered to Pants."
}
[/block]
## File arguments vs. target arguments

Goal arguments can be of one of two types:

- *File arguments*: file paths and/or globs.
- *Target arguments*: addresses and/or address globs of [targets](doc:targets).

Typically you can just use file arguments, and not worry about targets.

Any goal can take either type of argument: 

- If a target argument is given, the goal acts on all the files in the matching targets.
- If a file argument is given, Pants will map the file back to its containing target to read any necessary metadata. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "File/target globs",
  "body": "For file arguments, use `'*'` and `'**'`, with the same semantics as the shell. Reminder: quote the argument if you want Pants to evaluate the glob, rather than your shell.\n\nFor target arguments, you can use:\n\n- `dir::`, where `::` means every target in the current directory and recursively in subdirectories.\n- `dir:`, where `:` means every target in that directory, but not subdirectories.\n\nFor example, `./pants list ::` will find every target in your project."
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Tip: advanced target selection, such as running over changed files",
  "body": "See [Advanced target selection](doc:advanced-target-selection) for alternative techniques to specify which files/targets to run on."
}
[/block]
## Goal options

Many goals also have [options](doc:options) to change how they behave. Every option in Pants can be set via an environment variable, config file, and the command line.

To see if a goal has any options, run `./pants help $goal` or `./pants help-advanced $goal`. See [Command Line Help](doc:getting-help) for more information.

For example:

```
❯ ./pants help test
17:20:14.24 [INFO] Remote cache/execution options updated: reinitializing scheduler...
17:20:15.36 [INFO] Scheduler initialized.

`test` goal options
-------------------

Run tests.

Config section: [test]

  --[no-]test-debug
  PANTS_TEST_DEBUG
  debug
      default: False
      current value: False
      Run tests sequentially in an interactive process. This is necessary, for example, when you
      add breakpoints to your code.

...
```

You can then use the option by prefixing it with the goal name:

```bash
./pants --test-debug test project/app_test.py
```

You can also put the option after the file/target arguments:

```bash
./pants test project/app_test.py --test-debug
```

As a shorthand, if you put the option after the goal and before the file/target arguments, you can leave off the goal name in the flag:

```bash
./pants test --debug project/app_test.py
```
