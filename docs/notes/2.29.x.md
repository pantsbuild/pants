# 2.29.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

Adds a label to `docker_environment` containers so pantsd can cleanup any old, dead containers on startup. This prevents [old containers existing forever](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/18307) in the event of a pantsd crash.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Python

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to v2.45.2.

#### Javascript

Enable setting missing common fields e.g "tags" for the `node_build_script`-symbol and resulting `NodeBuildScriptTarget`.

Added missing help text to NodeBuildScriptEntryPointField.

#### TypeScript

Dependency inference now considers `.d.ts` declaration files. For example, `import { ... } from './declaration'` will be inferred to (also) refer to `./declaration.d.ts` if it exists.
