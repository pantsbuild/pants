# 2.29.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

Adds a label to `docker_environment` containers so pantsd can cleanup any old, dead containers on startup. This prevents [old containers existing forever](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/18307) in the event of a pantsd crash.

Fixed an issue where environment targets with empty sequence fields would override global configuration instead of inheriting from it. This affected multiple backends including Docker, Python, and NodeJS. For the Docker backend, empty `docker_env_vars` fields in `docker_environment` targets would prevent inheritance from global `[docker].env_vars` settings, causing Docker buildx to fail due to missing required environment variables like `HOME`. (See [#20605](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/20605))



### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22565) a bug that would cause dependency inference (`k8s_parser`) to fail for Kubernetes manifests containing only yaml comments.

#### JVM

Document nailgun compatibility issues.

Fixed a bug with Coursier dependency resolution that could cause the wrong artifact to be pulled in if multiple artifacts were published for the same coordinate only distinguished by classifier.

#### Python

The default interpreter constraints for tools have been standardized to require Python between 3.9 and 3.13. The default lockfiles have
been generated to match. Some default tool versions were upgraded (see below). If you are specifically relying on a Python 3.8 interpreter to run a tool, or if you require a different version of a tool than the new default, then you will need to generate
a custom lockfile for that tool with the appropriate interpreter constraints.

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to `v2.50.2`. Among other changes this includes support for Pip [25.2](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v25-2).

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250808`.

Adds default module mappings for confluent-kafka and discord.py.

The Ruff tool has been upgraded from 0.11.5 to [0.12.5](https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.12.0) by default.

The Black tool has been upgraded from 24.8.0 to [24.10.0](https://github.com/psf/black/releases/tag/24.10.0) by default.

The Flake8 tool has been upgraded from 5.0.4 to [6.1.0](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/release-notes/6.1.0.html) by default.

The Yapf tool has been upgraded from 0.40.2 to [0.43.0](https://pypi.org/project/yapf/0.43.0/) by default.

The Coverage tool has been upgraded from 7.6.1 to [7.10.4](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.10.4/changes.html#version-7-10-4-2025-08-16) by default.

The Mypy tool has been upgraded from 1.11.2 to [1.17.1](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#mypy-1-17) by default.


#### Javascript

Enable setting missing common fields e.g "tags" for the `node_build_script`-symbol and resulting `NodeBuildScriptTarget`.

Added missing help text to NodeBuildScriptEntryPointField.

#### TypeScript

Dependency inference now considers `.d.ts` declaration files. For example, `import { ... } from './declaration'` will be inferred to (also) refer to `./declaration.d.ts` if it exists.
