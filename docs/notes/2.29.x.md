# 2.29.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

The `pants_ignore_use_gitignore`-option now applies to nested .gitignore files.
This may require an update of the patterns in `pants_ignore`. In particular, after upgrading, you will have to allowlist (e.g `!pattern`) any path that you relied on pants not ignoring via nested .gitignore files.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Javascript

Enable setting missing common fields e.g "tags" for the `node_build_script`-symbol and resulting `NodeBuildScriptTarget`.

Added missing help text to NodeBuildScriptEntryPointField.

### Plugin API changes
