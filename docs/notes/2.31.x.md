# 2.31.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### Removals

Removed `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` which was used for migration during the deprecation period of `globs()`, `rglobs()`, and `zglobs()` in [Pants 1.26](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9040). This functionality, including the associated deprecation message, was removed in [Pants 1.27](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9247). The deprecation message pointed (through a URL shortener) to this file located on `master`. If you still require access to `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` - you can download it from [the 2.29 tagged release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantsbuild/pants/refs/tags/release_2.29.0/build-support/migration-support/fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py).

### General

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

#### JVM

#### Python

Added the `[python].default_to_resolve_interpreter_constraints` option which when set the true, allows Python targets with both `interpreter_constraints` and `resolve` fields to fallback on their resolve's interpreter constraints before the global constraints if no interpreter constraints are set on the actual target.

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to [`v2.69.1`](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.69.1).

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20251031`

#### Shell

#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

#### Go

Go now compiles with trimpath to strip sandbox paths from output, allowing for reproducible builds.

### Plugin API changes

Pants no longer supports loading `pkg_resources`-style namespace packages for plugins. Instead, just use ["native namespace packages"](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages) as per [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).

#### nFPM backend

Added a new rule to help in-repo plugins implement the `inject_nfpm_package_fields(InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest) -> InjectedNfpmPackageFields` polymorphic rule. The `get_package_field_sets_for_nfpm_content_file_deps` rule (in the `pants.backend.nfpm.util_rules.contents` module) collects selected `PackageFieldSet`s from the contents of an `nfpm_*_package` so that the packages can be analyzed to inject things like package requirements.

Added prioritized rule chaining for `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` polymorphic rule implementations. Before, only one request type was allowed to inject fields on each `nfpm_*_package` target. Now, the `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` subclasses can declare a priority (as `ClassVar[int]`) so that the rule runs after lower-priority requests and before higher-priority requests. By default, `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` implementations are priority 10, and any subclasses have that priority increased by 1 so that the subclass is higher priority than its parent class. Any implementations distributed with pants should have a lower priority (`< 10`) so that in-repo and external plugins can override the pants-provided defaults.
