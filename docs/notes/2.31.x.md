# 2.31.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### Removals

Removed `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` which was used for migration during the deprecation period of `globs()`, `rglobs()`, and `zglobs()` in [Pants 1.26](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9040). This functionality, including the associated deprecation message, was removed in [Pants 1.27](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9247). The deprecation message pointed (through a URL shortener) to this file located on `master`. If you still require access to `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` - you can download it from [the 2.29 tagged release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantsbuild/pants/refs/tags/release_2.29.0/build-support/migration-support/fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py).

Folling the annoucement in in the [2.30.x](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.30.x/docs/notes/2.30.x.md) release, Pants 2.31.x no longer provides binaries for `x86_64` macOS.  This flows from the [reduced support](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/13046) from GitHub and continued movement in the macOS ecosystem.  If you are interested in maintaining or resurrecting supporting `x86_64` macOS binaries, please [reach out](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/22711).


### General

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

#### JVM

#### Python

A variety of Pex options to support building [native executables
"scies"](https://github.com/a-scie/) are now plumbled through.  While a
traditional PEX is a "Python Executable" that can be run by a Python
interpreter, a scie PEX takes that a step forward by including its own Python.
This is similar to the way the [launcher
binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants)
used by Pants itself works.

Added the `[python].default_to_resolve_interpreter_constraints` option which when set the true, allows Python targets with both `interpreter_constraints` and `resolve` fields to fallback on their resolve's interpreter constraints before the global constraints if no interpreter constraints are set on the actual target.

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to [`v2.69.2`](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.69.2). This fixes an [bug](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22886) that hindered the use of multiple custom package indexes.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20251031`

The default interpreter constraints for tools have been standardized to require Python from 3.9 to 3.14. The default lockfiles have been generated to match. No top-level subsystem tools were updated, but several tool dependencies were. The most notable being `protobuf` updated from 6.33.0 to [6.33.1](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/6.33.1/).

#### Shell

#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

#### Go

Go now compiles with trimpath to strip sandbox paths from output, allowing for reproducible builds.

#### NEW: nFPM Native Libs

Added a new experimental `pants.backend.experimental.nfpm.native_libs` backend to complement the [`nFPM`](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/) backend (originally added in [pants 2.23](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/main/docs/notes/2.23.x.md#new-nfpm)). `nFPM` builds system packages, but, unlike native packaging tools, does not inspect packaged binaries to automatically record package `depends` (aka `requires`). The nFPM Native Libs backend is meant to fill that feature gap, simplifying package dependency management.

Initially, this backend only supports:
- `rpm` packages (by inspecting the dependencies of `nfpm_rpm_package` targets;
- native libraries packaged as wheels in `pex_binary` targets;
- native libraries and binaries in the [`ELF`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) format (used on linux);

So, this backend provides a simplified set of features from these native packaging tools:
- `rpm`: `elfdeps` analyzes ELF metadata and `rpmdeps` adds the requirements to the `.rpm` file.

This backend should be platform-agnostic, allowing it to run wherever `pants` can run. To do this, it relies on the [`elfdeps`](https://github.com/python-wheel-build/elfdeps) [📦](https://pypi.org/project/elfdeps/) pure-python package (a "Python implementation of RPM `elfdeps`" with its pure-python dep [`pyelftools`](https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools) [📦](https://pypi.org/project/pyelftools/)) for analyzing `ELF` libraries.

Please provide feedback on this backend [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/22396).

### Plugin API changes

Pants no longer supports loading `pkg_resources`-style namespace packages for plugins. Instead, just use ["native namespace packages"](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages) as per [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).

#### nFPM backend

Added a new rule to help in-repo plugins implement the `inject_nfpm_package_fields(InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest) -> InjectedNfpmPackageFields` polymorphic rule. The `get_package_field_sets_for_nfpm_content_file_deps` rule (in the `pants.backend.nfpm.util_rules.contents` module) collects selected `PackageFieldSet`s from the contents of an `nfpm_*_package` so that the packages can be analyzed to inject things like package requirements.

Added prioritized rule chaining for `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` polymorphic rule implementations. Before, only one request type was allowed to inject fields on each `nfpm_*_package` target. Now, the `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` subclasses can declare a priority (as `ClassVar[int]`) so that the rule runs after lower-priority requests and before higher-priority requests. By default, `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest` implementations are priority 10, and any subclasses have that priority increased by 1 so that the subclass is higher priority than its parent class. Any implementations distributed with pants should have a lower priority (`< 10`) so that in-repo and external plugins can override the pants-provided defaults.
