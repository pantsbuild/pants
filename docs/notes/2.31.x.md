# 2.31.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

#### JVM

#### Python

A variety of Pex options to support building [native executables
"scies"](https://github.com/a-scie/) are now plumbled through.  While a
traditional PEX is a "Python Executable" that can be run by a Python
interpreter, a scie PEX takes that a step forward by including its own Python.
This is similar to the way the [launcher
binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants)
used by Pants itself works.

Added the `[python].default_to_resolve_interpreter_constraints` option which when set the true, allows Python targets with both `interpreter_constraints` and `resolve` fields to fallback on their resolve's interpreter constraints before the global constraints if no interpreter constraints are set on the actual target.

#### Shell

#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

#### Go

Go now compiles with trimpath to strip sandbox paths from output, allowing for reproducible builds.

### Plugin API changes

Pants no longer supports loading `pkg_resources`-style namespace packages for plugins. Instead, just use ["native namespace packages"](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages) as per [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).

#### nFPM backend

Added a new rule to help in-repo plugins implement the `inject_nfpm_package_fields(InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest) -> InjectedNfpmPackageFields` polymorphic rule. The `get_package_field_sets_for_nfpm_content_file_deps` rule (in the `pants.backend.nfpm.util_rules.contents` module) collects selected `PackageFieldSet`s from the contents of an `nfpm_*_package` so that the packages can be analyzed to inject things like package requirements.
