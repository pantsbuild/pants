# 2.31.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### Removals

Removed `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` which was used for migration during the deprecation period of `globs()`, `rglobs()`, and `zglobs()` in [Pants 1.26](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9040). This functionality, including the associated deprecation message, was removed in [Pants 1.27](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/9247). The deprecation message pointed (through a URL shortener) to this file located on `master`. If you still require access to `fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py` - you can download it from [the 2.29 tagged release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantsbuild/pants/refs/tags/release_2.29.0/build-support/migration-support/fix_deprecated_globs_usage.py).

### General

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

#### JVM

#### Python

Added the `[python].default_to_resolve_interpreter_constraints` option which when set the true, allows Python targets with both `interpreter_constraints` and `resolve` fields to fallback on their resolve's interpreter constraints before the global constraints if no interpreter constraints are set on the actual target.

#### Shell

#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

#### Go

Go now compiles with trimpath to strip sandbox paths from output, allowing for reproducible builds.

### Plugin API changes

Pants no longer supports loading `pkg_resources`-style namespace packages for plugins. Instead, just use ["native namespace packages"](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages) as per [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).
