# 2.21.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights

- Automatic retries of tests for all built-in backends.

Keep reading to see the details and what's also included.

### Overall

All built-in targets that support testing with the `pants test` goal now support automatic retries, using [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/test#attempts_default).

When running in CI, the printed summary at the end of a `pants test ...` run will now include single invocation to rerun all failing tests, if any. This can be controlled by [the new `[test].show_rerun_command` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/test#show_rerun_command).

Option values can now be optionally [read from files using `@?...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options#reading-individual-option-values-from-files). For instance, `opt = "@some_file.txt"` will give an error if `some_file.txt` does not exist, but the new syntax `opt = "@?some_file.txt"` will just leave the option unset.

The `stats` subsystem can now output structured data, using [the new `[stats].format = "jsonlines"` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/subsystems/stats#format). This is designed to make ingesting and analysis this information easier, such as tracking information about CI builds.

Introspection goals have had a few improvements:

* [`pants peek ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/using-pants/project-introspection#peek---programmatically-inspect-a-target) now includes a `goals` field for some targets

* Using the `json` format for [`pants dependencies ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/dependencies#format) or [`pants dependencies ...`](format#format) now correctly obeys the `output_file` setting.

### BUILD files


### Remote caching/execution


### Backends

#### Adhoc


#### Docker

The [`cache_from` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/targets/docker_image#cache_from) on `docker_image` now supports multiple values.

The [new `extra_run_args` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/targets/docker_image#extra_run_args) on `docker_image` allows adding extra arguments that are passed into the `docker run ...` invocation when running the image with `pants run`.

Pants now correctly extracts the image ID when using `docker buildx` version 0.13.1 or greater.

#### Go

Failing `go_packagee` tests can now be automatically retried by setting [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/go#retries).

#### Helm

Failing `helm_unittest_test` tests can now be automatically retried by setting [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/helm#retries).

[The `sources` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/targets/helm_chart#sources) of `helm_chart` targets now includes documentation files like `README.md` and  `values.schema.json` so that they are available once published.

Versions 3.13.3 and 3.14.3 of the Helm tool are know [known](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/subsystems/helm#known_versions). Version 3.14.3 is now [the default version](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/subsystems/helm#version).

The `experimental-deploy` goal now has built-in support for [the `--dry-run` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/experimental-deploy#dry_run), which passes that to the underlying Helm invocation.

#### JavaScript

Failing `javascript_test` tests can now be automatically retried by setting [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/test#attempts_default).

`package_json` targets using yarn v2 or greater as the package manager are now supported.

#### JVM

Failing `kotlin_junit_test`, `junit_test`, and `scala_junit_test` tests can now be automatically retried by setting [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#retries).

##### Scala

The Scalafix can now be run by Pants using the [new `pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafix` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#fix-scala-code).

#### Python


#### Shell

Failing `shunit2_test` and `experimental_test_shell_command` tests can now be automatically retried by setting [the `[test].attempts_default` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/shell#retries).

#### Terraform

The `experimental-deploy` goal now has built-in support for [the `--dry-run` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/experimental-deploy#dry_run), which runs `terraform plan` instead of `terraform apply`.

#### TypeScript


### Plugin API changes
