# 2.24.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights



### Deprecations



### General



### Backends

#### Python

The default lockfiles bundled with Pants for various tools (ex: to run `black`) no longer support Python 3.7.  The minimum Python version is now 3.8.  Pants still supports running Python 3.7 (and earlier!) user code, but you will need to [generate your own lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/python/overview/lockfiles#lockfiles-for-tools).  See the announcement at <https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2024/08/24/venerable-pythons> for further context.

As a consequence of the lockfile generation, newer versions of many tools are now included in the default lockfiles.

The versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` used in Pants have been upgraded to `74.1.2` and `0.44.0` to address a remote code execution vulnerability in versions before setuptools `70.0`. This forces the minimum Python version to 3.8, in line with the changes mentioned above.

#### S3

The `pants.backend.url_handlers.s3` backend now correctly passes along query parameters such as `versionId` for `s3://` urls.

#### Shell

Pants will now warn if any errors are encountered while fingerprinting candidate binaries for the `system_binary` target type. The warnings may be disabled by setting the new `log_fingerprinting_errors` field on `system_binary` to `False`.



### Plugin API changes

Plugins may now use `DeleteRule` to delete rules from other backends to override behavior.
