# 2.24.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights



### Deprecations

- **Python 2.7**: As announced in the v2.23.x release series, Pants v2.24 and later are not proactively tested in CI with Python 2.7 since [Python 2.7 is no longer supported by its maintainers as of 1 January 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). While Pants may continue to work with Python 2.7 in the near term, Pants no longer officially supports use of Python 2.7, and, consequently, any remaining support for Python 2.7 may "bit rot" and diverge over time. Contributions to fix issues with Python 2.7 support will continue to be accepted, but will depend on any community contributions and will not consitute continued official support for Python 2.7.
