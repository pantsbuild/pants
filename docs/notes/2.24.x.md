# 2.24.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights



### Deprecations

- **Python 2.7**: As announced in the v2.23.x release series, Pants v2.24 and later are not proactively tested in CI with Python 2.7 since [Python 2.7 is no longer supported by its maintainers as of 1 January 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). While Pants may continue to work with Python 2.7 in the near term, Pants no longer officially supports use of Python 2.7, and, consequently, any remaining support for Python 2.7 may "bit rot" and diverge over time. Contributions to fix issues with Python 2.7 support will continue to be accepted, but will depend on any community contributions and will not constitute continued official support for Python 2.7.
- **macOS versions**: Pants v2.24 is the last version that will support macOS 12, as macOS 12 is reaching the end of Apple's support. Future versions of Pants will require macOS 14 or newer (on arm64), and macOS 13 or newer (on x86-64). In addition, as announced in the v2.23.x release series, Pants v2.24 is built on macOS 12 and so may not work on versions of macOS 10.15 and 11 (which Apple no longer supports).


### General

* Fixed bug where `pants peek --include-additional-info` was not actually displaying the additional info ([#21399](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21399)).

### New Options System

This release switches the Pants [options system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options) to use the new "native" implementation written in Rust first introduced in the 2.22.x series.

To ensure that this transition is not disruptive, this release will run the new system alongside the "legacy" options system, and compare their results, issuing a warning if they differ.

If you encounter such discrepancies, and you can't resolve them easily, please [reach out to us on Slack or file an issue](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help).

The "legacy" system will be removed in the 2.25.x series.

### Goals

#### Export

Many tools that Pants downloads can now be exported using [the new `export --bin` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/reference/goals/export#bin). For example, `pants export --bin="helm"` will export the `helm` binary to `dist/export/bin/helm`. For each tool, all the files are exported to a subfolder in `dist/export/bins/`, and the main executable is linked to `dist/export/bin/`.

### Backends

#### JVM

Compression of class files into a jar file is not reading or writing from the remote cache. The size of jar files, combined with the low computational cost of compression, can outweigh the advantages of using a remote cache.

Fixed a coursier fetch wrapper script bug on nixos.

Fixed a jvm.sh script bug on nixos.

#### Kotlin

The kotlin linter, [ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/), has been updated to version 1.3.1.

#### Python

User API Changes:
- Update default package mapping for `pymupdf` to match imports from both `fitz` (the legacy name) and `pymupdf` (the [currently supported name](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#problems-after-installation).

Deprecations:

- Pants v2.24 and later are not proactively tested in CI with Python 2.7 since [Python 2.7 is no longer supported by its maintainers as of 1 January 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). While Pants may continue to work with Python 2.7 in the near term, Pants no longer officially supports use of Python 2.7, and, consequently, any remaining support for Python 2.7 may "bit rot" and diverge over time. Contributions to fix issues with Python 2.7 support will continue to be accepted, but will depend on any community contributions and will not constitute continued official support for Python 2.7.

- The default lockfiles bundled with Pants for various tools (ex: to run `black`) no longer support Python 3.7.  The minimum Python version is now 3.8.  Pants still supports running Python 3.7 (and earlier!) user code, but you will need to [generate your own lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/python/overview/lockfiles#lockfiles-for-tools).  See the announcement at <https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2024/08/24/venerable-pythons> for further context.

- The deprecation of `resolve_local_platforms` (both a field of `pex_binary`, and a option of `[pex-binary-defaults]`) has expired and thus they have been removed.

Version Updates:

- As a consequence of the lockfile generation, newer versions of many tools are now included in the default lockfiles.

- The default version of pip is now [24.2](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v24-2) bringing performance improvements to dependency resolution and support or the upcoming Python 3.13 release.

- The versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` used in Pants have been upgraded to `74.1.2` and `0.44.0` to address a remote code execution vulnerability in versions before setuptools `70.0`. This forces the minimum Python version to 3.8, in line with the changes mentioned above.

- The default version of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool has been updated from 2.16.2 to [2.20.3](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.20.3).

- The default version of the [Pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/) tool has been updated from 1.1.365 to [1.1.383](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.383).


A new experimental [Python Provider](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/03/31/two-hermetic-pythons) using [Python Build Standalone](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/) is available as `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`.  This joins the existing [pyenv provider](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/reference/subsystems/pyenv-python-provider) as a way for Pants to take care of providing an appropriate Python.


#### S3

The `pants.backend.url_handlers.s3` backend now correctly passes along query parameters such as `versionId` for `s3://` urls.

#### Shell

Pants will now warn if any errors are encountered while fingerprinting candidate binaries for the `system_binary` target type. The warnings may be disabled by setting the new `log_fingerprinting_errors` field on `system_binary` to `False`.

#### Shell

Added a new `cache_scope` field to `adhoc_tool` and `shell_command` targets to allow configuration of the "cache scope" of the invoked process. The cache scope determines how long Pants will cache the result of the invoked process absent any other invalidation of the result via source or dependency changes.

#### Go

Fix a bug where Pants raised an internal exception which occurred when compiling a Go package with coverage support when the package also had an external test which imported the base package.

Recognize `-fullpath` as a test binary flag.

Add support for the `all:` prefix to patterns used with the `go:embed` directive. The `all:` prefix includes files which start with `_` or `.` which are ordinarilly excluded .

### Plugin API changes

The `path_metadata_request` intrinsic rule can now access metadata for paths in the local system outside of the build root. Use the new `namespace` field on `PathMetadataRequest` to request metdata on local system paths using namespace `PathNamespace.SYSTEM`.

PyO3, the interface crate between Rust and Python, has been upgraded to v0.22.x. A major change is that all Python values on the Rust side must be handled via either the `pyo3::Bound` or `pyo3::Py` smart pointers; direct references such as `&PyAny` are no longer supported.

`GenerateToolLockfileSentinel` is removed. See the [porting guide details](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/writing-plugins/common-plugin-tasks/plugin-upgrade-guide#deprecated-generatetoollockfilesentinel) for instructions on migrating.
