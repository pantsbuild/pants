# 2.20.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

- Support for more remote-caching providers: file system and GitHub Actions Cache.
- New helpers for defining "adhoc" code-quality tools, without requiring a full plugin.
- JVM third-party artifacts can now be read from `pom.xml` files, and other related improvements.
- Go 1.22 can now be used.

Keep reading to see the details and what's also included.

### Overall

The dependency goals now support JSON output using the `--format` option for easier [introspection of the dependency graph](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/project-introspection#export-dependency-graph). For instance, [`pants dependencies --format=json ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/dependencies#format) and [`pants dependents --format=json ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/dependents#format).

The [new `[stats].output_file` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/stats#output_file) allows appending the stats output to a file, rather than printing it on stdout. This allows hiding this output on CI, while still ensuring it's available when required.

[The `[GLOBAL].pants_ignore` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#pants_ignore) no longer ignores `.github` by default, so files within that directory will now be visible to Pants automatically.

Using [the `--changed-...` options](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/changed) to only run on files that have been edited now no longer emits spurious warnings if files have been deleted.

We've made many changes to documentation, including:

- How to use [the `.pants.bootstrap` file](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options#pantsbootstrap-file) for running commands before start-up or setting default environment variables or similar.
- How to use [the `[cli].alias` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/advanced-target-selection#using-cli-aliases) for abbreviating common pants invocations.
- How to use [the `target` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files#using-the-generic-target) to abbreviate common `dependencies=["..."]` parameters.
- An improved version of [the nuking script](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/using-pants-in-ci#directories-to-cache) when doing coarse-grained caching in CI, like GitHub Actions.
- Several pages have been renamed or moved: existing links to 2.19 and earlier will still work, but their locations in 2.20 may have changed.

### BUILD files

The new `pants.backend.build_files.fmt.ruff` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format `BUILD` files.

### Remote caching/execution

Pants now has experimental support for additional remote cache providers beyond the gRPC Remote Execution API. Set [the `[GLOBAL].remote_provider` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_provider), to be able to use:

- [the GitHub Actions Cache](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/remote-caching#github-actions-cache)
- [a local directory](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/remote-caching#local-file-system)

In support of this, [the `[GLOBAL].remote_oauth_bearer_token` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_oauth_bearer_token) has been added to set the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. [The `[GLOBAL].remote_oauth_bearer_token_path` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_oauth_bearer_token_path) has been deprecated in favour of using the new option with [a file reference](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options#reading-individual-option-values-from-files): `remote_oauth_bearer_token = "@/path/to/file.txt"`.

[The `[GLOBAL].remote_cache_warnings` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_cache_warnings) now supports `always`.

### Backends

#### Adhoc

The [new `code_quality_tool` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/code_quality_tool) in the `pants.backend.experimental.adhoc` backend allows defining "adhoc" linters, formatters and fixers without requiring a full plugin. For example, in-repository scripts or a tool not already supported by Pants itself. See [#20135](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20135) for an example of how to use this.

#### Docker

The [new `{full_directory}` interpolation](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/docker/tagging-docker-images#setting-a-repository-name) in `repository` and `default_repository` options expands to the full path to the `BUILD` file that contains a `docker_image` target.

The new `pants.backend.experimental.docker.podman` backend allows using [Podman](https://podman.io). Add that backend to `backend_packages` and the Docker backend will invoke Podman instead of Docker. [The new option `[docker].experimental_enable_podman`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/docker#experimental_enable_podman) allows disabling this once the backend is loaded.

Dependency inference now works for parameterized targets, like `ARG base="path/to:target@param=value"`.

Pants is now able to extract the image ID when building a docker image with a daemon using the containerd-snapshotter feature.

The default version of Hadolint has been updated from 2.10.0 to 2.12.1-beta. This fixes an segmentation fault error when running on MacOS.

#### Go

Support for Go 1.22+, by no longer passing the `-compiling-runtime` flag when not necessary.

Eliminated a non-linear blow-up in the algorthm for gathering pre-build Go object files when using CGo.

#### Helm

The [new `lint_quiet` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/helm_chart#lint_quiet) on `helm_chart` allows passing `--quiet` to `helm lint ...`.

The `repository` field on `helm_chart` now allows trailing slashes.

The `--timeout` flag can now be passed through to `helm upgrade` operations.

#### JavaScript

The [`pants.backend.experimental.javascript` experimental backend](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-javascript) has had a few bug-fixes:

- [`package_json` targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/package_json) that use `yarn` now support running `node_build_scripts`.
- Dependencies are inferred from `export ... from ...` statements, similar to `import ... from ...`.

#### JVM

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for third-party dependencies:

- The [new `jvm_artifacts` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifacts) supports creating `jvm_artifact` dependency targets from `pom.xml` files.
- The [new `force_version` field on `jvm_artifact`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifact#force_version) allows passing the `--force-version` flag to Coursier for particular artifacts.
- The [new `[coursier].jvm_index` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/coursier#jvm_index) allows setting the index used by Coursier.

Most codegen backends now support dependency inference, including Protobuf, SOAP, Thrift and OpenAPI.

Pants support for [IDE integration via the BSP protocol](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#working-in-an-ide) now supports Scala plugins.

The JVM documentation has been rearranged to put [Java and Scala](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala) and [Kotlin](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/kotlin) on an equal footing.

##### Scala

Plugins that cause `scalac` to emit additional compilation results (such as `semanticdb`, `scalajs` and `scalanative`) are now supported, by wrapping all results into a single `jar`.

Support for [the Scala REPL](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#repl) is now documented.

#### Python

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for Ruff:

- The new `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.format` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format Python files.
- The existing `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` linter backend has been renamed to `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check`, and its tool ID (as used by commands like `pants lint --only=...`) has changed from `ruff` to `ruff-check`.
- Pants now automatically finds Ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` files in subdirectories, for instance, `python/pyproject.toml`.
- Pants' built-in default version has been updated to 0.2.1.

This release brings several changes related to [the pex tool](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) and `pex_binary` targets:

- It has been updated to to 2.1.163 by default. The minimum supported version is now 2.1.148.
- The [new `sh_boot` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#sh_boot) allows opting in to using a shell script rather than a Python script, which can be faster and more reliable in some cases.
- The [new `executable` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#executable) on `pex_binary` targets exposes pex's `--executable` option.
- The [new `[pex].emit_warnings` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/pex#emit_warnings) allows controlling whether warnings from pex invocations are shown or not.
- The [existing `emit_warnings` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#emit_warnings) on `pex_binary` targets now works as described, when set to `True`.
- Relatedly, Pants now exposes the recently-added `--check` option that allows being warned in advance if a `pex_binary` target will not be able to be opened by CPython. The [new `check` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#check) allows adjusting the behaviour (default: warn).
- If a `pex_binary` has [an `entry_point` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#entry_point) that is ambiguous, Pants now treats this as an unowned dependency. Previously this would silently do nothing.

The new [`local_scheme`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/vcs_version#local_scheme) and [`version_scheme`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/vcs_version#version_scheme) fields on the `vcs_version` target allow additional customization of its behaviour.

Improvements to dependency inference:

- [Strings imports](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/python-infer#string_imports) are handled more reliably, including obeying `pants: no-infer-dep` comments and having fewer false positives on invalid module names.
- Django-specific dependency inference (via the `pants.backend.experimental.python.framework.django` backend) now infers migrations and management commands as dependencies of `apps.py`.

[The `pants.backend.codegen.protobuf.python` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/python/integrations/protobuf-and-grpc) now supports [using `grpclib`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/python/integrations/protobuf-and-grpc#use-alternative-grpc-plugins) in addition to `grpcio` for generating GRPC service stubs.

Default module mappings were added for more modules: `django-countries`, `django-fsm`, `django-object-actions`, `django-postgres-extra`, `django-redis`, `django-scim2`, `djangorestframework-api-key`, `djangorestframework-queryfields`, `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth`, `grpcio-health-checking`, `grpcio-reflection`, `honeycomb-opentelemetry`, `opencv-python-headless`, `opentelemetry-sdk` (expanded to cover more modules). The special `_typeshed` module no longer has errors if imported.

`pip list` now behaves correctly in venvs created via `export` with [the `[export].py_editable_in_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/export#py_editable_in_resolve) enabled.

There is now documentation on how to [exclude files from Black or isort](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/python/overview/linters-and-formatters#black-and-isort-excluding-files).

The deprecation for the `[export].symlink_python_virtualenv` option has expired and it has been removed. Instead set [the `[export].py_resolve_format` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/export#py_resolve_format) to `symlinked_immutable_virtualenv`.

#### Terraform

The `pants.backend.experimental.terraform` Terraform backend now has [built-in support for lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/terraform#lockfiles), using the `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=path/to:module` goal, passing the address of the `terraform_module` target as the resolve.

There are now separate target types for [vars files](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/terraform_var_files) and [backend configs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/terraform_backend), which are handled as normal dependencies in the `dependencies` field. See the new [instructions for Terraform deployments](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/terraform#deployments).

The default built-in version of Terraform has been upgraded from 1.4.6 to 1.7.1. Pants now has [built-in knowledge of versions up to 1.7.1](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#known_versions), so the version can be overridden by setting [`[download-terraform].version`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#version) explicitly.


#### NEW: TypeScript

The `pants.backend.experimental.typescript` experimental backend now exists with support for tailoring [`typescript_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/typescript_sources) and [`typescript_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/typescript_tests) targets. Note: [dependency inference](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20293) and other built-in functionality is not yet implemented.

### Plugin API changes

Pants is undergoing a long term project to switch to [a new "call by name" syntax](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/19730). There will be a "fix-up" tool once the new syntax is ready for wide-spread use. This release adds supports for positional arguments. ([#20366](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20366))

`AbstractLintRequest` subclasses can now disable lint rules via the `enable_lint_rules` class var, if the automatic linter is not required. ([#20407](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20407))

Plugins loaded from the current repository (by extending `[GLOBAL].pythonpath`) now support specifying their requirements in a `requirements.txt` file adjacent to `register.py`. ([#20355](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20355))

`FrozenDict`s comparison and hashing functions now behave more like the superclass `dict` ones, being order-insensitive and allowing comparison to `dict` itself. ([#20221](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20221))

Previously, backtraces have been improved, to lose less information when interacting with the Rust core code. ([#20517](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20517))

The documentation has been extended with more information and additional examples:

- how to [use `HydratedSources` to convert a list of file and target paths into just file paths](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/rules-and-the-target-api#sourcesfield) ([#20524](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20524))
- how to [write an integration test that requires loading a backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/testing-plugins#approach-4-run_pants-integration-tests-for-pants) ([#20451](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20451))
- how to [write a unit test for a `@rule`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/testing-plugins#approach-2-run_rule_with_mocks-unit-tests-for-rules) ([#20452](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20452))
- how to profile Pants with [py-spy](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/contributions/development/debugging-and-benchmarking#cpu-profiling-with-py-spy) and [memray](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/contributions/development/debugging-and-benchmarking#memory-profiling-with-memray) ([#20334](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20334))

The deprecation has expired for the `@rule_helper` decorator. To resolve, just remove it: `@rule`s can now call any functions and `async` functions can now call `Get` and `MultiGet` directly.
