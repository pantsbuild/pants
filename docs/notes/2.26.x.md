# 2.26.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

New kubernetes backend! See [docs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/kubernetes) for details.

### Remote caching/execution

- Remote cache: `FindMissingBlobsRequest` will now make multiple request if the number of files is large. (https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20708)

### Deprecations


### General

- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21959) a bug where exponential backoff of file downloads could wait up to 18 days between retries under the default settings. [The `[GLOBAL].file_downloads_retry_delay ` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/global-options#file_downloads_retry_delay) is now used as a multiplier (previously it was the exponential base), and so any customisation of this option may need reconsideration for the new behaviour.

### Goals


### Backends

#### Python

Some deprecations have expired and been removed:

- the `[export].py_hermetic_scripts` option has been replaced by [the `[export].py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/goals/export#py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve)
- for FaaS targets (AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions), automatic fallback to underspecified "platforms" for unknown runtimes without a pre-packaged complete-platforms has been replaced by requiring an [explicit `complete_platforms` value](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#complete_platforms)

The default version of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool has been updated from 2.32.0 to [2.33.1](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.33.1).  Among many improvements and bug fixes, this unlocks support for pip [25.0.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v25-0-1).

The default version of the [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) tool has been updated from [0.7.2](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.7.2) to [0.9.6](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.9.6).

The Pants repo now uses Ruff format in lieu of Black. This was not a drop-in replacement, with over 160 files modified (and about 5 MyPy errors introduced by Ruff's formatting).

#### Shell

The `experiemental_test_shell_command` target type may now be used with the `test` goal's `--debug` flag to execute the test interactively.

#### Terraform

For the `tfsec` linter, the deprecation of support for leading `v`s in the `version` and `known_versions` field has expired and been removed. Write `1.28.13` instead of `v1.28.13`.
