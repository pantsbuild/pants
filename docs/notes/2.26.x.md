# 2.26.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

- New Kubernetes backend
- Upgrades of the default versions for many tools
- Publishing Docker images non-interactively and in parallel
- Much faster Ruff invocations on macOS

### General

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21959) a bug where exponential backoff of file downloads could wait up to 18 days between retries under the default settings. [The `[GLOBAL].file_downloads_retry_delay ` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/global-options#file_downloads_retry_delay) is now used as a multiplier (previously it was the exponential base), and so any customisation of this option may need reconsideration for the new behaviour.

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22024) handling of non-absolute paths in `PATH` (see [#21954](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21954) for more info).

#### New call-by-name syntax for @rules

Pants has a new mechanism for `@rule` invocation in backends. In this release the following backends were migrated to use this new mechanism. There should not be any user-visible effects, but please be on the lookout for any unusual bugs or error messages.

#### Tool upgrades

The default versions of various external tools have been upgraded. The previous default versions are still supported, by pinning using the `version = "..."` field within the subsystem in `pants.toml`.

| Subsystem     | Backend                                                                  | Old version | New version |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| buildifier    | `pants.backend.build_files.fmt.buildifier`                               | "7.1.2"     | "8.0.3"     |
| golangci-lint | `pants.backend.experimental.go.lint.golangci_lint`                       | "1.51.1"    | "1.64.6"    |
| helm-unittest | `pants.backend.experimental.helm`                                        | "0.3.3"     | "0.8.0"     |
| kubeconform   | `pants.backend.experimental.helm.check.kubeconfirm`                      | "0.6.2"     | "0.6.7"     |
| nfpm          | `pants.backend.experimental.nfpm`                                        | "2.38.0"    | "2.41.3"    |
| pex-cli       | `pants.backend.python`                                                   | "2.33.1"    | "2.33.4"    |
| pyenv         | `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.pyenv`                      | "2.4.7"     | "2.5.3"     |
| ruff          | `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check`                      | "0.9.6"     | "0.11.0"    |
| ruff          | `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.format`                     | "0.9.6"     | "0.11.0"    |

Other tools have also been upgraded, and can be pinned using backend-specific methods (such as overriding the lockfile used):

| Subsystem     | Backend                                               | Old version | New version |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

| nodejs (pnpm) | `pants.backend.experimental.javascript`               | 9.5.0       | 9.15.6      |
| prettier      | `pants.backend.experimental.javascript.lint.prettier` | 2.6.2       | 3.5.2       |
| pytype        | `pants.backend.experimental.python.typecheck.pytype`  | 2023.6.16   | 2024.9.13   |
| pyright       | `pants.backend.experimental.python.typecheck.pyright` | 1.1.383     | 1.1.396     |

### Remote caching/execution

When using an REAPI cache, any `FindMissingBlobsRequest`s will [now](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20708) make multiple request if the number of files is large.

### Backends

#### NEW: Kubernetes

Pants now has a `pants.backend.experimental.k8s` backend to manipulate and deploy kubernetes templates. The [new docs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/docs/kubernetes) have more details.

The new `pants.backend.experimental.codegen.python_format_string` and `pants.backend.experimental.codegen.python_format_string.k8s` backends are also helpful, and documented along with the kubernetes backends.

#### Docker

Added the ability to push docker images non-interactively. This, in turn, allows us to push docker images in parallel within one `pants publish` invocation.
To enable this option, add the following to your `pants.toml`

``` toml
[docker]
publish_noninteractively = true
```

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22118) a bug on package to correctly handle base images referenced by digest only.

#### Go

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22091) handling local-path replace lines in go.mod (see [#14996](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/14996) for more info).

#### Javascript

The Node.js runtime was upgraded from version [22.6.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.14.0) to version [22.14.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.14.0).

The [default `[nodejs].package_mangers`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/subsystems/nodejs#package_managers) were upgraded to their latest, non-breaking, versions:

- npm: 10.8.2 → 10.9.2
- pnpm: 9.5.0 → 9.15.6
- yarn: 1.22.22 (not upgraded)

The default version of [Prettier](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/subsystems/prettier) was upgraded from [2.6.2](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/releases/tag/2.6.2) to [3.5.2](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/releases/tag/3.5.2).

Fixed a bug several bugs:

- Dependency inference now correctly handles imports with file suffixes (e.g., `.generated.js`).
- Typescript source files (`.ts` and `.tsx`) are now added to the sandbox during JavaScript test execution.
- [The `npm_distribution` target type](https://www.pantsbuild.org/prerelease/reference/targets/npm_distribution) is now properly published. It can be used to create publishable npm registry distributions.

##### TypeScript

Dependency inference now correctly handles imports with file suffixes (e.g., `.generated.ts`).

#### Python

The Ruff backends (`pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check`, `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.format`) have had several improvements:

- Far less overhead for concurrent executions on macOS: the executable is now hard-linked into sandboxes, which side-steps Gatekeeper checks on macOS (when enabled, as they are by default) that made concurrent executions behave as if they were run sequentially.
- The default version of the [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) tool has been updated from [0.7.2](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.7.2) to [0.11.0](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.11.0).

Several tools other tools have had their default versions updated too:

- [Pex](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/subsystems/pex-cli) has been updated from 2.32.0 to [2.33.2](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.33.2).  Among many improvements and bug fixes, this unlocks support for pip [25.0.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/2.26/news/#v25-0-1).
- [Pytype](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/subsystems/pytype) has been updated from version 2023.6.16 to [2024.9.13](https://github.com/google/pytype/blob/be0b83df7f4a3d6df0586ac95b062c51a76c3432/CHANGELOG#L26). This is the last version that supports Python 3.8 and Python 3.9.
- [Pyright](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/subsystems/pyright) has been updated from version [1.1.383](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.383) to [1.1.396](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.396).

The Python backend now uses the PyPI `packaging` distribution to parse all Python version numbers and requirements instead of the deprecated `pkg_resources` distribution. In upgrading `packaging` from v21.3 to v24.2 and in removing uses of `pkg_resources`, several user-visible changes occurred:
- There is no more support for parsing "legacy" Python versions. We do not anticipate an issue here (since [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) has been around since 2013), but please contact the maintainers if an issue does arise.
- Requirements containing a version with a trailing `.*` pattern are only valid when used with the `==` or `!+` operators; for example, `==3.9.*` or `!=3.10.*`. Pants previously accepted such requirements when used with the other operators (e.g., `<=`, `<`, `>`, or `>=`) because `pkg_resources` accepted that syntax. The [current version specifiers specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/) does not allow that syntax and thus `packaging`'s requirements parser does not either.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250311`.

The Rust-based dependency inference logic now handles concatenated string literals properly and so imports such as `__import__("foo" ".bar")` will infer a dependency on `foo.bar`.

The `pip` download log from `pex` is now materialized into the sandbox when generating lockfiles. For example: `pants --keep-sandboxes=always generate-lockfiles --resolve=foo` will create a sandbox in `/tmp/.../pants-sandbox-.../` with a file named `pex-pip-download.log`.

Mypy cache is no longer shared between resolves to address shared cache false positives. New cache location is found in `${named_caches_dir}/mypy_cache/<build_root_hash>/<resolve_name>/<py_version>/cache.db`.

The `pants.backend.experimental.python.framework.django` Django backend now allows a repo to have no Django apps without error.

[The `pex_binary.complete_platforms` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/targets/pex_binary#complete_platforms) can [now](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22059) accept a codegened source, such as the result of an `shell_command`.

Some deprecations have expired and been removed:

- The `[export].py_hermetic_scripts` option has been replaced by [the `[export].py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/goals/export#py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve)
- For FaaS targets (AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions), automatic fallback to underspecified "platforms" for unknown runtimes without a pre-packaged complete-platforms has been replaced by requiring an [explicit `complete_platforms` value](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#complete_platforms)


#### S3

The S3 backend now creates new AWS credentials when the `AWS_` environment variables change. This allows credentials to be updated without restarting the Pants daemon.

#### Shell

The `experimental_test_shell_command` target type is no longer experimental and is stabilized as [the `test_shell_command` target type](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/targets/test_shell_command). As part of stablilizing it, `test_shell_command` learned several new features:

- It now supports the `test` goal's `--debug` flag to execute tests interactively.
- Outputs may now be captured as test "extra outputs" as specified by the new `output_files`, `output_directories`, `root_output_directory`, and `outputs_match_mode` fields. (These fields operate in the same manner as for the `shell_command` target type.) Captured output will be written in a directory under `dist/` based on the target name when a test completes.
- It now supports the `runnable_dependencies` field already supported by the `shell_command` target type.

#### Terraform

For the `tfsec` linter, the deprecation of support for leading `v`s in the `version` and `known_versions` field has expired and been removed. Write `1.28.13` instead of `v1.28.13`.

### Plugin API changes

`@rule` decorators have been re-typed, which should allow better call site return-type visibility (fewer `Unknown`s and `Any`s). Decorator factories of the form `@rule(desc=..., level=..., ...)` have also been strongly typed. This may cause typechecking errors for plugin authors, if the plugin is using incorrect types. However, this likely would have manifested as a runtime crash, otherwise.

The Pants repo now uses Ruff format in lieu of Black. This was not a drop-in replacement, with over 160 files modified (and about 5 MyPy errors introduced by Ruff's formatting). This _should_ require no change from plugin authors.
