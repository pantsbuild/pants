# 2.26.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

#### Python

Some deprecations have expired and been removed:

- the `[export].py_hermetic_scripts` option has been replaced by [the `[export].py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/goals/export#py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve)
- for FaaS targets (AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions), automatic fallback to underspecified "platforms" for unknown runtimes without a pre-packaged complete-platforms has been replaced by requiring an [explicit `complete_platforms` value](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#complete_platforms)

#### Terraform

For the `tfsec` linter, the deprecation of support for leading `v`s in the `version` and `known_versions` field has expired and been removed. Write `1.28.13` instead of `v1.28.13`.
