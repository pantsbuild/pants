# 2.26.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

New kubernetes backend! See [docs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/kubernetes) for details.

### Remote caching/execution

- Remote cache: `FindMissingBlobsRequest` will now make multiple request if the number of files is large. (https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20708)

### Deprecations


### General

- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21959) a bug where exponential backoff of file downloads could wait up to 18 days between retries under the default settings. [The `[GLOBAL].file_downloads_retry_delay ` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.26/reference/global-options#file_downloads_retry_delay) is now used as a multiplier (previously it was the exponential base), and so any customisation of this option may need reconsideration for the new behaviour.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22024) handling of non-absolute paths in PATH (see [#21954](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21954) for more info).

#### New call-by-name syntax for @rules

Pants has a new mechanism for `@rule` invocation in backends. In this release the following backends were migrated to use this new mechanism. There should not be any user-visible effects, but please be on the lookout for any unusual bugs or error messages.

### Goals


### Backends


#### Docker

Added the ability to push docker images non-interactively. This, in turn, allows us to push docker images in parallel within one `pants publish` invocation.
To enable this option, add the following to your `pants.toml`

``` toml
[docker]
publish_noninteractively = true
```

#### Javascript

The Node.js runtime was upgraded from version [22.6.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.14.0) to version [22.14.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.14.0).

The default package managers were upgraded to their latest, non-breaking, versions:

npm: 10.8.2 -> 10.9.2
pnpm: 9.5.0 -> 9.15.6
yarn: 1.22.22

[Prettier](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/reference/subsystems/prettier) default version was upgraded from [2.6.2](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/releases/tag/2.6.2) to [3.5.2](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/releases/tag/3.5.2).

Fixed a bug on dependency inference to correctly handle imports with file suffixes (e.g., `.generated.js`).

#### Python

Some deprecations have expired and been removed:

- the `[export].py_hermetic_scripts` option has been replaced by [the `[export].py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/goals/export#py_non_hermetic_scripts_in_resolve)
- for FaaS targets (AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions), automatic fallback to underspecified "platforms" for unknown runtimes without a pre-packaged complete-platforms has been replaced by requiring an [explicit `complete_platforms` value](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#complete_platforms)

The default version of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool has been updated from 2.32.0 to [2.33.2](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.33.2).  Among many improvements and bug fixes, this unlocks support for pip [25.0.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v25-0-1).

The default version of the [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) tool has been updated from [0.7.2](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.7.2) to [0.9.6](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.9.6).

The Pants repo now uses Ruff format in lieu of Black. This was not a drop-in replacement, with over 160 files modified (and about 5 MyPy errors introduced by Ruff's formatting).

`@rule` decorators have been re-typed, which should allow better call site return-type visibility (fewer `Unknown`s and `Any`s). Decorator factories of the form `@rule(desc=..., level=..., ...)` have also been strongly typed. This may cause typechecking errors for plugin authors, if the plugin is using incorrect types. However, this likely would have manifested as a runtime crash, otherwise.

A bug in the Django backend has been fixed so that a repo may have no Django apps without error. 

[Pytype](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/reference/subsystems/pytype) was updated to version 2024.9.13 - which is the [last to support Python 3.8 and Python 3.9](https://github.com/google/pytype/blob/main/CHANGELOG).

[Pyright](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/reference/subsystems/pyright) was updated from version [1.1.383](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.383) to [1.1.396](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.396).

The Python backend uses the PyPI `packaging` distribution to parse Python version numbers and requirements instead of the deprecated `pkg_resources` distribution. In upgrading `packaging` from v21.3 to v24.2 and in removing uses of `pkg_resources`, several user-visible changes occurred:
- There is no more support for parsing "legacy" Python versions. We do not anticipate an issue here (since [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) has been around since 2013), but please contact the maintainers if an issue does arise.
- Requirements containing a version with a trailing `.*` pattern are only valid when used with the `==` or `!+` operators; for example, `==3.9.*` or `!=3.10.*`. Pants previously accepted such requirements when used with the other operators (e.g., `<=`, `<`, `>`, or `>=`) because `pkg_resources` accepted that syntax. The [current version specifiers specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/) does not allow that syntax and thus `packaging`'s requirements parser does not either.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250212`.

The Rust-based dependency inference logic now handles concatenated string literals properly and so imports such as `__import__("foo" ".bar")` will be properly handled.

#### Shell

The `experiemental_test_shell_command` target type is no longer experimental and is stabilized as the `test_shell_command` target type. As part of stablilizing it, `test_shell_command` learned several new features:

- It now supports the `test` goal's `--debug` flag to execute tests interactively.
- Outputs may now be captured as test "extra outputs" as specified by the new `output_files`, `output_directories`, `root_output_directory`, and `outputs_match_mode` fields. (These fields operate in the same manner as for the `shell_command` target type.) Captured output will be written in a directory under `dist/` based on the target name when a test completes.
- It now supports the `runnable_dependencies` field already supported by the `shell_command` target type.

#### Terraform

For the `tfsec` linter, the deprecation of support for leading `v`s in the `version` and `known_versions` field has expired and been removed. Write `1.28.13` instead of `v1.28.13`.

#### TypeScript

Fixed a bug on dependency inference to correctly handle imports with file suffixes (e.g., `.generated.ts`).

#### S3

The S3 backend now creates new AWS credentials when the `AWS_` environment variables change. This allows credentials to be updated without restarting the Pants daemon.
