# 2.32.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

Support for the deprecated `Get()`/`MultiGet()` in the plugin API has been removed.

### Deprecations

The plugin API's `Get()` and `MultiGet()` constructs, deprecated in 2.30, are now unsupported. If your plugin still relies on them you must [migrate](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) before upgrading to this version.

### General

### Goals

#### Publish

`PublishFieldSet` now has a `check_skip_request` hook to enable preemptive skips of packaging requests for targets where the publishing will be skipped (such as when a `skip_push=True` field exists).

### Backends

#### Docker

The option `[docker].push_on_package` can be used to prevent Docker images from being pushed during packaging, i.e. when `--output` contains `push=True` or `type=registry`.

Running `pants publish` on a `docker_image` target with `skip_push=True` will no longer package the `docker_image`.

#### Helm

When `pants publish` is invoked, Pants will now skip packaging for `helm_chart` targets if either `skip_push=True` or the target has no registries.

#### JVM

#### Python

`pants tailor` now supports custom glob patterns for detecting Python tests. This makes it easier to get started with
Pants when your test files (e.g., `*_tests.py`) don't match the default patterns.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `220260127`.

When `pants publish` is invoked, Pants will now skip packaging for `python_distribution` targets if either `skip_twine=True`, the target has no registries, or if `[twine].skip = true`.

Pants will attempt to only preserve the `mypy` cache when `mypy` returns a [probably-not-a-crash](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6003) exit code.  This is intended as a defensive guard against propagating crash induced inconsistencies back to the ["named cache"](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.32/reference/global-options#named_caches_dir) and propagated to future runs.

The default version of mypy used by Pants has been updated to [1.19.1](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2025/11/mypy-119-released.html).  This includes support for the new "Fixed‑Format" cache.

The `grpc-python-plugin` tool now uses an updated `v1.73.1` plugin built from  <https://github.com/nhurden/protoc-gen-grpc-python-prebuilt]. This also brings `macos_arm64` support.
