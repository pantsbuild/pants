# 2.32.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

Support for the deprecated `Get()`/`MultiGet()` in the plugin API has been removed.

### Deprecations

The plugin API's `Get()` and `MultiGet()` constructs, deprecated in 2.30, are now unsupported. If your plugin still relies on them you must [migrate](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) before upgrading to this version.
