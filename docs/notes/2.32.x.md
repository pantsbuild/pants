# 2.32.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

#### New: Codespell

Pants now supports running [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) as a linter.  `codespell` isn't a regular spell checker with a full dictionary, rather it is intended to be used on source code with a much smaller list of common misspelling.

Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.tools.codespell` backend to try it out.
