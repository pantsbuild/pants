# 2.32.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

Support for the deprecated `Get()`/`MultiGet()` in the plugin API has been removed.

### Deprecations

The plugin API's `Get()` and `MultiGet()` constructs, deprecated in 2.30, are now unsupported. If your plugin still relies on them you must [migrate](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) before upgrading to this version.

### General

### Goals

#### Publish

`PublishFieldSet` now has a `check_skip_request` hook to enable preemptive skips of packaging requests for targets where the publishing will be skipped (such as when a `skip_push=True` field exists).

### Backends

#### Docker

The option `[docker].push_on_package` can be used to prevent Docker images from being pushed during packaging, i.e. when `--output` contains `push=True` or `type=registry`.

#### Helm

When `pants publish` is invoked, Pants will now skip packaging for `helm_chart` targets if either `skip_push=True` or the target has no registries.

#### JVM

#### Python

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `220260127`.

#### Shell

#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

#### Go

### Plugin API changes
