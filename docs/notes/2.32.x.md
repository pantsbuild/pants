# 2.32.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

Support for the deprecated `Get()`/`MultiGet()` in the plugin API has been removed.

### Deprecations

The plugin API's `Get()` and `MultiGet()` constructs, deprecated in 2.30, are now unsupported. If your plugin still relies on them you must [migrate](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) before upgrading to this version.

### General

### Internal Python Upgrade

The version of Python used by Pants itself has been updated to [3.14](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html). To support this, the [Pants Launcher Binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants) (also known as [`scie-pants`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/)) now has a minimum version of `0.13.0`. To update to the latest launcher binary, either:
- Use the package manager you used to install Pants. For example, with Homebrew: `brew update && brew upgrade pantsbuild/tap/pants`.
- Use its built-in self-update functionality: `SCIE_BOOT=update pants`.

Note: Pants uses its own separately-installed Python installation to run itself. This installation is managed by the Pants Launcher Binary. The Pants choice of Python 3.14 for its own code does not limit the versions of Python that you can use to test and build your own code.

For GitHub Actions users that use the [pantsbuild/actions/init-pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/actions/tree/main/init-pants) action with `setup-python-for-plugins=true`, you will need to update your GHA workflows to use [v11](https://github.com/pantsbuild/actions/releases/tag/v11) or newer to get the correct version of Python.

### Goals

#### Publish

`PublishFieldSet` now has a `check_skip_request` hook to enable preemptive skips of packaging requests for targets where the publishing will be skipped (such as when a `skip_push=True` field exists).

### Backends

#### Docker

The option `[docker].push_on_package` can be used to prevent Docker images from being pushed during packaging, i.e. when `--output` contains `push=True` or `type=registry`.

Running `pants publish` on a `docker_image` target with `skip_push=True` will no longer package the `docker_image`.

#### Helm

When `pants publish` is invoked, Pants will now skip packaging for `helm_chart` targets if either `skip_push=True` or the target has no registries.

#### JVM

#### Python

`pants tailor` now supports custom glob patterns for detecting Python tests. This makes it easier to get started with
Pants when your test files (e.g., `*_tests.py`) don't match the default patterns.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `220260127`.

When `pants publish` is invoked, Pants will now skip packaging for `python_distribution` targets if either `skip_twine=True`, the target has no registries, or if `[twine].skip = true`.

Pants will attempt to only preserve the `mypy` cache when `mypy` returns a [probably-not-a-crash](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6003) exit code.  This is intended as a defensive guard against propagating crash induced inconsistencies back to the ["named cache"](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.32/reference/global-options#named_caches_dir) and propagated to future runs.

The default version of mypy used by Pants has been updated to [1.19.1](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2025/11/mypy-119-released.html).  This includes support for the new "Fixed‑Format" cache.

The `runtime` field of [`aws_python_lambda_layer`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.32/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_layer#runtime) or [`aws_python_lambda_function`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.32/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#runtime) now has built-in complete platform configurations for x86-64 and arm64 Python 3.14. This provides stable support for Python 3.14 lambdas out of the box, allowing deleting manual `complete_platforms` configuration if any.

The `grpc-python-plugin` tool now uses an updated `v1.73.1` plugin built from  <https://github.com/nhurden/protoc-gen-grpc-python-prebuilt]. This also brings `macos_arm64` support.
