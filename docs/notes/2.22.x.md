# 2.22.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights

- A new implementation of the options system.

### New options system

This release introduces a major re-implementation of the Pants [options system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options). This is the code responsible for parsing and applying configuration options from command-line flags, environment variables and config files. The existing "legacy" options system was written in Python. The new "native" implementation is written in Rust.

The two systems are expected to be more-or-less functionally identical. We plan to switch to the native system in release 2.23.x, and remove the legacy system in release 2.24.x. However to ensure that this transition is not disruptive, this release and the next one will run both systems and compare their results, issuing a warning if they differ.

If you encounter such discrepancies, and you can't resolve them easily, please [reach out to us on Slack or file an issue](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help).

### Backends

#### JVM

##### Scala

Setting the `orphan_files_behaviour = "ignore"` option for [`pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafix`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/subsystems/scalafix#orphan_files_behavior) or [`pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafmt`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/subsystems/scalafmt#orphan_files_behavior) backend is now properly silent. It previously showed spurious warnings.

#### Python

[The `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/subsystems/ruff) now uses version 0.4.1 by default.

The new `layout="loose"` field for AWS Lambda [function](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_function#layout), [layer](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/targets/python_aws_lambda_layer#layout) and [Google Cloud Function](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/targets/python_google_cloud_function#layout) targets outputs the artefact as a directory, rather than a zip file.

Initial support for Python 3.13 (pre-release) has been added. NB. built-in tool like black will [not yet](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/20852) run with Python 3.13.

The [PyOxizider tool is effectively stagnant](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/7410). [The `pants.backend.experimental.python.packaging.pyoxidizer` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/python/integrations/pyoxidizer) docs now have a note reflecting this.

Default module mappings were added for more modules:

The deprecation for the `platforms` field for the `pex_binary` and `pex_binaries` targets has expired, and so has been removed. The `resolve_local_platforms` field is now meaningless and is thus deprecated.

#### Shell

[The `pants.backend.shell.lint.shfmt` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/shell#shfmt-autoformatter) now uses shfmt version 3.8.0 by default.

#### Yaml

Setting [the `orphan_files_behaviour = "ignore"` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/subsystems/yamllint#orphan_files_behavior) the `pants.backend.experimental.tools.yamllint` backend is now properly silent. It previously showed spurious warnings.
