# 2.27.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

Changing [the `--keep-sandboxes=...` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#keep_sandboxes) no longer forces the Pantsd daemon to restart.

The Pants install now includes the `hdrhistogram` dependency automatically, and thus statistics logging (as enabled by [the `[stats].log` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/stats#log)) includes histograms of metrics by default. If this is too verbose, consider redirecting to a file by default using [the `[stats].output_file` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/stats#output_file). This change means `hdrhistogram` does not need to be included in [the `[GLOBAL].plugins` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#plugins): this was previously required to see histograms (and recommended by docs like ["Using Pants in CI"](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/docs/using-pants/using-pants-in-ci)), but is no longer necessary.

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].native_options_validation` option and it has been removed. The option already has no effect and can be safely deleted.

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_before_12` option and it has been removed. The functionality has been replaced by [the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_versions` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#allow_deprecated_macos_versions).

The [workunit-logger](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/workunit-logger) will now log a stub with with `"json_serializable": False` for workunit metadata that can not be serialized instead of halting the process.

Process workunits now include local and remote digests for the action and command digests (eg `remote_action_digest`) in their artifacts when the local filesystem or a remote cache is used. The contents of the digests can be inspected using `fs_util` for debugging purposes.

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22128) a bug where missing `docker_environment` containers (i.e. containers killed or remove by some outside process) break pantsd and requires a pantsd restart. Now pants will attempt to start a new container for the `docker_environment`.

[Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/22207) a `UnicodeDecodeError` in Git commands with non UTF-8 output. Internal Git calls now return raw bytes and callers decode when needed.

#### New call-by-name syntax for @rules
Pants has a new mechanism for `@rule` invocation in backends. In this release the following backends were migrated to use this new mechanism. There should not be any user-visible effects, but please be on the lookout for any unusual bugs or error messages.

- [Python AWS Lambda](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/python/integrations/aws-lambda)
- [Python Protobuf](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/docs/python/integrations/protobuf-and-grpc)
- [Python Thrift](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/docs/python/integrations/thrift)
- [Buf Linter](https://www.pantsbuild.org/prerelease/docs/go/integrations/protobuf#buf-format-and-lint-protobuf)

### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

[The `[dockerfile-parser].use_rust_parser` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/dockerfile-parser) now defaults to true, meaning, by default, Dockerfiles are now parsed using the native Rust-based parser, which is faster and requires no external dependencies. The old parser is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Pants.

Run [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) on Dockerfiles to scan for vulnerable packages.

#### Helm

Run [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) on Helm Charts and deployments to scan for misconfigurations.

#### Javascript

Added support for formatting typescript and tsx files with Prettier.

Fixed a bug where `pnpm-workspaces.yaml` could affect NPM or Yarn projects - it should be ignored.

Allow extra env vars during nodejs invocations through [the `[nodejs].extra_env_vars` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/nodejs#extra_env_vars) and/or [the `extra_env_vars` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/targets/package_json#extra_env_vars) on `package_json` targets.

#### Python

The Pex tool has been upgraded from 2.33.4 to [2.36.0](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.36.0) by default. Among other changes this includes support for Pip [25.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v25-1).

The Ruff tool has been upgraded from 0.11.0 to 0.11.5 by default.

In [the `[ruff]` subsystem](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/ruff), the deprecations have expired for these options and thus they have been removed: `install_from_resolve`, `requirements`, `interpreter_constraints`, `consnole_script`, `entry_point`. The removed options already have no effect (they're replaced by the `version` and `known_versions` options), and can be safely deleted .

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250409`.

Packaging a `pex_binary` target for a local interpreter (that is, without `complete_platforms`) now works when using a Python provider like `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone` or `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.pyenv`.

The default module mappings now includes the `hdrhistogram` package (imported as `hdrh`).

Minor fixes:

- If a sandbox for executing mypy is preserved, the `__run.sh` script now refers to the main script by a relative path and [can thus be successfully executed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22138).

#### S3

The S3 backend now uses Signature Version 4 for signing requests, allowing use of KMS encrypted objects in S3. The HMACV1 signing can be enabled by setting [the `[s3-url-handler].auth_signing` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/s3-url-handler#auth_signing) to `hmacv1`.

#### Shell

The shell backend now has far less overhead when parsing shell imports on macOS: the shellcheck executable is now hard-linked into sandboxes, which side-steps Gatekeeper checks on macOS (when enabled, as they are by default) that made concurrent executions behave as if they were run sequentially.

#### Terraform

Now supports codegen for module dependencies. Dependencies may specify a target that generates a file that is consumed by the terraform module.

Now `terraform init` is run in the same invocation as commands which depend on it. This should resolve an issue for users of remote caches where the Terraform provider cache is not initialised on different nodes. 

Run [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) on Terraform modules and deployments to scan for misconfigurations.

### Plugin API changes

* Processes can now specify their `concurrency` requirements, influencing when Pants will execute them. Use `exclusive` to be the only running process, `exactly(n)` to require exactly `n` cpu cores, or `range(max=n, min=1)` to accept a value between `min` and `max` which is templated into the process's argv as `{pants_concurrency}`. The `concurrency` field supersedes the `concurrency_available` field, which will be deprecated in the future.
