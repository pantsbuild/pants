# 2.27.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations


### General

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].native_options_validation` option and it has been removed. The option already has no effect and can be safely deleted.

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_before_12` option and it has been removed. The functionality has been replaced by [the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_versions` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#allow_deprecated_macos_versions).

### Goals


### Backends

#### Docker

[The `[dockerfile-parser].use_rust_parser` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/dockerfile-parser) now defaults to true, meaning, by default, Dockerfiles are now parsed using the native Rust-based parser, which is faster and requires no external dependencies. The old parser is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Pants.

#### Python

The PEX tool has been upgraded from 2.33.4 to 2.33.7 by default.

In [the `[ruff]` subsystem](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/ruff), the deprecations have expired for these options and thus they have been removed: `install_from_resolve`, `requirements`, `interpreter_constraints`, `consnole_script`, `entry_point`. The removed options already have no effect (they're replaced by the `version` and `known_versions` options), and can be safely deleted .

Minor fixes:

- If a sandbox for executing mypy is preserved, the `__run.sh` script now refers to the main script by a relative path and [can thus be successfully executed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22138).
