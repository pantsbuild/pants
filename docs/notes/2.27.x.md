# 2.27.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations


### General

Changing [the `--keep-sandboxes=...` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#keep_sandboxes) no longer forces the Pantsd daemon to restart.

The Pants install now includes the `hdrhistogram` dependency automatically, and thus statistics logging (as enabled by [the `[stats].log` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/stats#log)) includes histograms of metrics by default. If this is too verbose, consider redirecting to a file by default using [the `[stats].output_file` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/stats#output_file). This change means `hdrhistogram` does not need to be included in [the `[GLOBAL].plugins` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#plugins): this was previously required to see histograms (and recommended by docs like ["Using Pants in CI"](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/docs/using-pants/using-pants-in-ci)), but is no longer necessary.

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].native_options_validation` option and it has been removed. The option already has no effect and can be safely deleted.

The deprecation has expired for the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_before_12` option and it has been removed. The functionality has been replaced by [the `[GLOBAL].allow_deprecated_macos_versions` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/global-options#allow_deprecated_macos_versions).

The [workunit-logger](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/workunit-logger) will now log a stub with with `"json_serializable": False` for workunit metadata that can not be serialized instead of halting the process.


### Goals


### Backends

#### Docker

[The `[dockerfile-parser].use_rust_parser` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/dockerfile-parser) now defaults to true, meaning, by default, Dockerfiles are now parsed using the native Rust-based parser, which is faster and requires no external dependencies. The old parser is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Pants.

#### Javascript

Added support for formatting typescript and tsx files with Prettier.

Fixed a bug where `pnpm-workspaces.yaml` could affect NPM or Yarn projects - it should be ignored.

#### Python

The PEX tool has been upgraded from 2.33.4 to 2.33.7 by default.

The Ruff tool has been upgraded from 0.11.0 to 0.11.5 by default.

In [the `[ruff]` subsystem](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/ruff), the deprecations have expired for these options and thus they have been removed: `install_from_resolve`, `requirements`, `interpreter_constraints`, `consnole_script`, `entry_point`. The removed options already have no effect (they're replaced by the `version` and `known_versions` options), and can be safely deleted .

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250317`.

The default module mappings now includes the `hdrhistogram` package (imported as `hdrh`).

Minor fixes:

- If a sandbox for executing mypy is preserved, the `__run.sh` script now refers to the main script by a relative path and [can thus be successfully executed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22138).

#### S3

The S3 backend now uses Signature Version 4 for signing requests, allowing use of KMS encrypted objects in S3. The HMACV1 signing can be enabled by setting [the `[s3-url-handler].auth_signing` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.27/reference/subsystems/s3-url-handler#auth_signing) to `hmacv1`.

#### Shell

The shell backend now has far less overhead when parsing shell imports on macOS: the shellcheck executable is now hard-linked into sandboxes, which side-steps Gatekeeper checks on macOS (when enabled, as they are by default) that made concurrent executions behave as if they were run sequentially.

### Plugin API changes

* Processes can now specify their `concurrency` requirements, influencing when Pants will execute them. Use `exclusive` to be the only running process, `exactly(n)` to require exactly `n` cpu cores, or `range(max=n, min=1)` to accept a value between `min` and `max` which is templated into the process's argv as `{pants_concurrency}`. The `concurrency` field supersedes the `concurrency_available` field, which will be deprecated in the future.
