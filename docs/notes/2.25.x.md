# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization,
and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was
established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is
[sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

Strict adherence to the [schema of Docker registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

#### Helm

Strict adherence to the [schema of Helm OCI registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.
