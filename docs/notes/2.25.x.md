# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

- **macOS versions**: Pants v2.25 is now built and tested on newer macOS versions: 13 (x86-64, previously 10.15) and macOS 14 (arm64, previously 11). The deprecation of the older versions were announced in Pants 2.23 and 2.24, and are driven by Apple's support schedule; they also help reduce cost for the volunteer-driven Pantsbuild organisation. Using Pants on older versions may or may not work.

### General

- Fixed a longstanding bug in the processing of [synthetic targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/writing-plugins/the-target-api/concepts#synthetic-targets-api). This fix has the side-effect of requiring immutability and hashability of scalar values in BUILD files, which was always assumed but not enforced. This may cause BUILD file parsing errors, if you have custom field types involving custom mutable data structures. See ([#21725](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21725)) for more.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21665) bug where `pants --export-resolve=<resolve> --export-py-generated-sources-in-resolve=<resolve>` fails (see [#21659](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21659) for more info).
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21694) bug where an `archive` target is unable to produce a ZIP file with no extension (see [#21693](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21693) for more info).
- `[subprocess-environment].env_vars` and `extra_env_vars` (on many subsystems and targets) now supports a generalised glob syntax using Python [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct patterns like `AWS_*`, `TF_*`, and `S2TESTS_*`.

#### Remote Caching/Execution

Pants now sends a `user-agent` header with every request to a remote store or a remote execution service,
even when other headers are configured. If necessary, the user may override the user agent by specifying
one in `remote_store_headers` or `remote_execution_headers`.

Pants now supports the `{chroot}` replacement marker in remote execution contexts. (With local and Docker execution, the `{chroot}` marker is replaced with the absolute path of the sandbox directory if it appears in program arguments or environment variables. Pants will do the same as well in remote execution contexts. This requires `/bin/bash` to be available on the remote execution server.)

The OpenDAL library powering the Github Actions cache backend has been updated, picking up some bug fixes for Github Enterprise Server instances using AWS S3 as backing storage for the Github Actions cache.

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Internal Python Upgrade

The version of Python used by Pants itself has been updated to [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html). To support this the [Pants Launcher Binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants) known as  [`scie-pants`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/) now has a minimum version of `0.12.2`.  To update to the latest launcher binary, either:
- Use the package manager you used to install Pants. For example, with Homebrew: `brew update && brew upgrade pantsbuild/tap/pants`.
- Use its built-in self-update functionality: `SCIE_BOOT=update pants`.

That Pants itself happens to be partially writtin in Python has no bearing on the versions of Python that Pants can use to test and build your code.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

Strict adherence to the [schema of Docker registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

Fixed an error which was caused when the same tool appeaed in both the `--docker-tools` and `--docker-optional-tools` options.

#### Helm

Strict adherence to the [schema of Helm OCI registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

The `helm_infer.external_docker_images` glob syntax has been generalized.  In addition to `*`, you can now use Python [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct patterns like `quay.io/*`.

Fixed a bug where linting with the Helm backend enabled could induce serialization errors with the [workunit-logger](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/workunit-logger).

#### Python

The AWS Lambda backend now provides built-in complete platforms for the Python 3.13 runtime.

Several improvements to the Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`):

- The backend now supports filtering PBS releases via their "release tag" via [the new `--python-build-standalone-release-constraints` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/python-build-standalone-python-provider#release_constraints). THe PBS "known versions" database now contains metadata on all known PBS versions, and not just the latest PBS release tag per Python patchlevel.

- The backend will now infer metadata for a PBS release from a given URL if the URL conforms to the naming convention used by the PBS project. The inferred metadata is Python version, PBS release tag, and platform.

- The `--python-build-standalone-known-python-versions` option now accepts a three field format where each value is `SHA256|FILE_SIZE|URL`. All of the PBS release metadata will be parsed from the URL (which must use the naming convention used by the PBS project). (The existing five-field format is still accepted and will now allow the version and platform fields to be blank if that data can be inferred from the URL.)

Reverence to Python Build Standalone not refer to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) as described in [Transferring Python Build Standalone Stewardship to Astral](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/12/03/transferring-python-build-standalone-stewardship-to-astral/).

The default version of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool has been updated from 2.20.3 to [2.27.1](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.24.3).  Among many improvements and bug fixes, this unlocks support for pip [24.3.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v24-3-1).

The `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check` backend [now supports](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21783) including [Ruff's output file as a report](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/python/overview/linters-and-formatters#bandit-flake8-pylint-and-ruff-report-files).

##### NEW: Python for OpenAPI

A new experimental `pants.backend.experimental.openapi.codegen.python` backend
was added to support python codegen for OpenAPI documents.

##### Black

[The `pants.backend.python.lint.black` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black) now uses version 24.8.0 by default, upgrading from 23.12.1. This comes with a new stable style (see [release notes for 24.1.0](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/change_log.html) for details) which may result in extensive reformatting.

To override Pants' default version, use [the `install_from_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black#install_from_resolve) and/or [the `interpreter_constraints` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black#interpreter_constraints). The style changes may be extensive, so, to make upgrading to Pants 2.25 easier, we provide the old lockfile as built-in, for now (Pants will remove this in future, so you should switch to your own lockfile, and/or upgrade to the default Black 24, soon). To use this lockfile, and remain on Black 23, configure a resolve as follows:

``` toml
# pants.toml

[python.resolves]
...
black = "resource://pants.backend.python.lint.black/black-23.12.lock"

[black]
install_from_resolve = "black"
```

To take control of your Black version independent of Pants' default, configure a resolve similar to the following, and generate the lockfile with `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=your-resolve-name`:

``` toml
# pants.toml

[python.resolves]
...
your-resolve-name = "3rdparty/python/your-resolve-name.lock"

[black]
install_from_resolve = "your-resolve-name"
```

``` python
# BUILD
python_requirement(name="black", resolve="your-resolve-name", requirements=["black>=23,<24"])
```
#### Shell

The previously deprecated `[shell-setup].tailor` option has now been removed. See [`[shell-setup].tailor_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell-setup#tailor_sources) and [`[shell-setup].tailor_shunit2_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell#tailor_shunit2_tests) to update.

### Plugin API changes

The version of Python used by Pants itself is now [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) (up from 3.9).

The oldest [glibc version](https://www.sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) supported by the published Pants wheels is now 2.28.  This should have no effect unless you are running on extremely old Linux distributions.  See <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux> for background context on Python wheels and C libraries.
