# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

- **macOS versions**: Pants v2.25 is now built and tested on newer macOS versions: 13 (x86-64, previously 10.15) and macOS 14 (arm64, previously 11). The deprecation of the older versions were announced in Pants 2.23 and 2.24, and are driven by Apple's support schedule; they also help reduce cost for the volunteer-driven Pantsbuild organisation. Using Pants on older versions may or may not work.

### General

- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21665) bug where `pants --export-resolve=<resolve> --export-py-generated-sources-in-resolve=<resolve>` fails (see [#21659](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21659) for more info).
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21694) bug where an `archive` target is unable to produce a ZIP file with no extension (see [#21693](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21693) for more info).

#### Remote Caching/Execution

Pants now sends a `user-agent` header with every request to a remote store or a remote execution service,
even when other headers are configured. If necessary, the user may override the user agent by specifying
one in `remote_store_headers` or `remote_execution_headers`.

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.


### Internal Python Upgrade

The version of Python used by Pants itself has been updated to [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html). To support this the [Pants Launcher Binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants) known as  [`scie-pants`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/) now has a minimum version of `0.12.0`.  To update to the latest launcher binary run:

```
SCIE_BOOT=update pants
```

That Pants itself happens to be partially writtin in Python has no bearing on the versions of Python that Pants can use to test and build your code.



### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

Strict adherence to the [schema of Docker registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

#### Helm

Strict adherence to the [schema of Helm OCI registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

The `helm_infer.external_docker_images` glob syntax has been generalized.  In addition to `*`, you can now use Python [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct matterns like `quay.io/*`.

#### Python

The AWS Lambda backend now provides built-in complete platforms for the Python 3.13 runtime.

#### Shell

The previously deprecated `[shell-setup].tailor` option has now been removed. See [`[shell-setup].tailor_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell-setup#tailor_sources) and [`[shell-setup].tailor_shunit2_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell#tailor_shunit2_tests) to update.

### Plugin API changes

The version of Python used by Pants itself is now [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) (up from 3.9).

The oldest [glibc version](https://www.sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) supported by the published Pants wheels is now 2.28.  This should have no effect unless you are running on extremely old Linux distributions.  See <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux> for background context on Python wheels and C libraries.
