# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

- **macOS versions**: Pants v2.25 is now built and tested on newer macOS versions: 13 (x86-64, previously 10.15) and macOS 14 (arm64, previously 11). The deprecation of the older versions were announced in Pants 2.23 and 2.24, and are driven by Apple's support schedule; they also help reduce cost for the volunteer-driven Pantsbuild organisation. Using Pants on older versions may or may not work.

### General

- Fixed a longstanding bug in the processing of [synthetic targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/writing-plugins/the-target-api/concepts#synthetic-targets-api). This fix has the side-effect of requiring immutability and hashability of scalar values in BUILD files, which was always assumed but not enforced. This may cause BUILD file parsing errors, if you have custom field types involving custom mutable data structures. See ([#21725](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21725)) for more.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21665) bug where `pants --export-resolve=<resolve> --export-py-generated-sources-in-resolve=<resolve>` fails (see [#21659](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21659) for more info).
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21694) bug where an `archive` target is unable to produce a ZIP file with no extension (see [#21693](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21693) for more info).

#### Remote Caching/Execution

Pants now sends a `user-agent` header with every request to a remote store or a remote execution service,
even when other headers are configured. If necessary, the user may override the user agent by specifying
one in `remote_store_headers` or `remote_execution_headers`.

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Internal Python Upgrade

The version of Python used by Pants itself has been updated to [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html). To support this the [Pants Launcher Binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants) known as  [`scie-pants`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/) now has a minimum version of `0.12.2`.  To update to the latest launcher binary, either:
- Use the package manager you used to install Pants. For example, with Homebrew: `brew update && brew upgrade pantsbuild/tap/pants`.
- Use its built-in self-update functionality: `SCIE_BOOT=update pants`.

That Pants itself happens to be partially writtin in Python has no bearing on the versions of Python that Pants can use to test and build your code.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

Strict adherence to the [schema of Docker registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

#### Helm

Strict adherence to the [schema of Helm OCI registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm#registries) is now required.
Previously we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

The `helm_infer.external_docker_images` glob syntax has been generalized.  In addition to `*`, you can now use Python [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct matterns like `quay.io/*`.

#### Python

The AWS Lambda backend now provides built-in complete platforms for the Python 3.13 runtime.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) now supports filtering PBS releases via their "release tag" via [the new `--python-build-standalone-release-constraints` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/python-build-standalone-python-provider#release_constraints).

#### Shell

The previously deprecated `[shell-setup].tailor` option has now been removed. See [`[shell-setup].tailor_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell-setup#tailor_sources) and [`[shell-setup].tailor_shunit2_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell#tailor_shunit2_tests) to update.

### Plugin API changes

The version of Python used by Pants itself is now [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) (up from 3.9).

The oldest [glibc version](https://www.sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) supported by the published Pants wheels is now 2.28.  This should have no effect unless you are running on extremely old Linux distributions.  See <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux> for background context on Python wheels and C libraries.
