# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support throughout this release!

## What's New

### Highlights

- New backend: Python for OpenAPI
- The AWS Lambda backend now provides built-in complete platforms for the Python 3.13 runtime.
- Javascript / Typescript dependency inference improvements
- Improvements to the [Python Build Standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/) Python provider backend
- Bug fixes!

### Deprecations

- **macOS versions**: Pants v2.25 is now built and tested on newer macOS versions: 13 (x86-64, previously 10.15) and macOS 14 (arm64, previously 11). The deprecation of the older versions was announced in Pants 2.23 and 2.24, and is driven by Apple's support schedule; it also helps reduce costs for the volunteer-driven Pantsbuild organization. Using Pants on older versions may or may not work.

### General

- Fixed a longstanding bug in the processing of [synthetic targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/writing-plugins/the-target-api/concepts#synthetic-targets-api). This fix has the side-effect of requiring immutability and hashability of scalar values in BUILD files, which was always assumed but not enforced. This may cause BUILD file parsing errors if you have custom field types involving custom mutable data structures. See ([#21725](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21725)) for more.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21665) a bug where `pants --export-resolve=<resolve> --export-py-generated-sources-in-resolve=<resolve>` fails (see [#21659](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21659) for more info).
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21694) a bug where an `archive` target is unable to produce a ZIP file with no extension (see [#21693](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21693) for more info).
- The `[subprocess-environment].env_vars` and `extra_env_vars` options (which are available on many subsystems and targets) now support a generalized glob syntax using Python's [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct patterns like `AWS_*`, `TF_*`, and `S2TESTS_*`.
- Suspicious values now generate a warning instead of a hard error when using the `<PATH>` special value to inject shell `PATH` values to the `system-binaries` subsystem.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21943) a bug where negative target specs (e.g., `-folder::`) were not recognized on the command line.

### Remote Caching/Execution

Pants now sends a `user-agent` header with every request to a remote store or a remote execution service, even when other headers are configured. If necessary, the user may override the user agent by specifying one in the [`[GLOBAL].remote_store_headers`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/global-options#remote_store_headers) or [`[GLOBAL].remote_execution_headers`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/global-options#remote_execution_headers) options.

Pants now supports the `{chroot}` replacement marker in remote execution contexts. (With local and Docker execution, the `{chroot}` marker is replaced with the absolute path of the sandbox directory if it appears in program arguments or environment variables. Pants will do the same now in remote execution contexts. This requires `/bin/bash` to be available on the remote execution server.)

The OpenDAL library powering the GitHub Actions cache backend has been updated, picking up support for the new GitHub Actions cache v2, and some bug fixes for GitHub Enterprise Server instances using AWS S3 as backing storage for the GitHub Actions cache.

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Internal Python Upgrade

The version of Python used by Pants itself has been updated to [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html). To support this, the [Pants Launcher Binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2023/02/23/the-pants-launcher-binary-a-much-simpler-way-to-install-and-run-pants) (also known as [`scie-pants`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/)) now has a minimum version of `0.12.2`. To update to the latest launcher binary, either:
- Use the package manager you used to install Pants. For example, with Homebrew: `brew update && brew upgrade pantsbuild/tap/pants`.
- Use its built-in self-update functionality: `SCIE_BOOT=update pants`.

Note: Pants uses its own separately-installed Python installation to run itself. This installation is managed by the Pants Launcher Binary. The Pants choice of Python 3.11 for its own code does not limit the versions of Python that you can use to test and build your own code.

For GitHub Actions users that use the [pantsbuild/actions/init-pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/actions/tree/main/init-pants) action with `setup-python-for-plugins=true`, you will need to update your GHA workflows to use [v10](https://github.com/pantsbuild/actions/releases/tag/v10) or newer to get the correct version of Python.

### Backends

#### Docker

Future versions of Pants will use a new parser for Dockerfiles, implemented in Rust. This parser is faster and does not require installing extra dependencies. To aid in this migration, you may opt-in by  setting [the `[dockerfile-parser].use_rust_parser` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/dockerfile-parser#use_rust_parser) to `true`. ([Please let us know](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) if you find any issues with the new parser):

``` toml
# Opt-in to the new parser now:
[dockerfile-parser]
use_rust_parser = true

# Or, continue using the old parser if you find issues with the new parser:
[dockerfile-parser]
use_rust_parser = false
```

Strict adherence to the [schema of Docker registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#registries) is now required. Previously, we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true"/"false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

Fixed an error which was caused when the same tool appeared in both the [`[docker].tools`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#tools) and [`[docker].optional_tools`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/docker#optional_tools) options.

Stages in multi-stage builds which only used a hash to identify the image version (that is, no tag) are now surfaced. They can now be used in the [`docker_image.target_state`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/targets/docker_image#target_stage) field.

#### Go

Fixed a bug with the setup of the gRPC protobuf plugins where a `go install` invocation was prevented from accessing the Go module proxy during its build of those plugins, which caused those builds to fail.

#### Helm

Strict adherence to the [schema of Helm OCI registry configuration](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm#registries) is now required. Previously, we did ad-hoc coercion of some field values, so that, e.g., you could provide a "true" / "false" string as a boolean value. Now we require actual booleans.

The [`helm_infer.external_docker_images`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/helm-infer#external_docker_images) glob syntax has been generalized. In addition to `*`, you can now use Python [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) to construct patterns like `quay.io/*`.

Fixed a bug where linting with the Helm backend enabled could induce serialization errors with the [workunit-logger](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/workunit-logger).

The default "globs" for matching yaml in charts now match more common structures.

#### Javascript

Fixed an issue where `pants run ...` commands only worked if the `package.json` file was in the root directory.

The dependency inference now considers `.ts` and `.tsx` file extensions.

The dependency inference now considers scoped npm packages.

The NodeJS subsystem now supports configuring additional tools that should be available in the NodeJS process execution. These tools can be configured via two options:

- [`[nodejs].tools`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/nodejs#tools): Specify additional executables required by NodeJS processes.
- [`[nodejs].optional_tools`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/nodejs#optional_tools): Additional tools that may be needed but aren't required. Unlike `tools`, the build won't fail if these aren't found. Useful for tools that only exist in some environments.

The paths to these tools will be included in the `PATH` used in the execution sandbox, so that they may be used by NodeJS processes during execution.

##### TypeScript

The dependency inference now considers `.tsx` files.

#### nFPM

The nFPM backend has a new plugin hook that allows plugins to inject field values that are used to generate nfpm config. To use this, a plugin needs to implement `InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest`:

```python
from pants.backend.nfpm.fields.version import NfpmVersionField, NfpmVersionReleaseField
from pants.backend.nfpm.util_rules.inject_config import InjectedNfpmPackageFields, InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest
from pants.engine.internals.native_engine import Address, Field
from pants.engine.rules import rule

class MyCustomInjectFieldsRequest(InjectNfpmPackageFieldsRequest):
    @classmethod
    def is_applicable(cls, target) -> bool:
        # this could check the target's address, packager, package_name field, etc.
        return True

@rule
def inject_my_custom_fields(request: MyCustomInjectFieldsRequest) -> InjectedNfpmPackageFields:
    # this could get the version from a file
    version = "9.8.7-dev+git"
    release = 6
    fields: list[Field] = [
        NfpmVersionField(version, request.target.address),
        NfpmVersionReleaseField(release, request.target.address),
    ]
    return InjectedNfpmPackageFields(fields, address=request.target.address)
```

#### Python

The AWS Lambda backend now provides built-in complete platforms for the Python 3.13 runtime.

Constrained the transitive dependencies within the built-in lockfile for twine to work around a [bug](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/21893).

Several improvements to the Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`):

- The backend now supports filtering PBS releases via their "release tag" via [the new `--python-build-standalone-release-constraints` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/python-build-standalone-python-provider#release_constraints). The PBS "known versions" database now contains metadata on all known PBS versions, and not just the latest PBS release tag per Python patch level.

- The backend will now infer metadata for a PBS release from a given URL if the URL conforms to the naming convention used by the PBS project. The inferred metadata is Python version, PBS release tag, and platform.

- The [`--python-build-standalone-provider-known-python-versions`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/python-build-standalone-python-provider#known_python_versions) option now accepts a three-field format where each value is `SHA256|FILE_SIZE|URL`. All of the PBS release metadata will be parsed from the URL (which must use the naming convention used by the PBS project). (The existing five-field format is still accepted and will now allow the version and platform fields to be blank if that data can be inferred from the URL.)

- Metadata on PBS releases is current to PBS release 20250212.

- Changed references to Python Build Standalone to refer to the new [GitHub organization](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) as described in [Transferring Python Build Standalone Stewardship to Astral](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/12/03/transferring-python-build-standalone-stewardship-to-astral/).

The default version of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool has been updated from 2.20.3 to [2.32.1](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.32.1). Among many improvements and bug fixes, this unlocks support for pip [24.3.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v24-3-1) and Pip [25.0](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v25).

The `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check` backend [now supports](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21783) including [Ruff's output file as a report](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/python/overview/linters-and-formatters#bandit-flake8-pylint-and-ruff-report-files).

##### NEW: Python for OpenAPI

A new experimental `pants.backend.experimental.openapi.codegen.python` backend was added to support Python codegen for OpenAPI documents.

##### Black

[The `pants.backend.python.lint.black` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black) now uses version 24.8.0 by default, upgrading from 23.12.1. This comes with a new stable style (see [release notes for 24.1.0](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/change_log.html) for details) which may result in extensive reformatting.

To override Pants' default version, use [the `install_from_resolve` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black#install_from_resolve) and/or [the `interpreter_constraints` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/black#interpreter_constraints). The style changes may be extensive, so, to make upgrading to Pants 2.25 easier, we provide the old lockfile as built-in, for now (Pants will remove this in the future, so you should switch to your own lockfile, and/or upgrade to the default Black 24, soon). To use this lockfile, and remain on Black 23, configure a resolve as follows:

``` toml
# pants.toml

[python.resolves]
...
black = "resource://pants.backend.python.lint.black/black-23.12.lock"

[black]
install_from_resolve = "black"
```

To take control of your Black version independent of Pants' default, configure a resolve similar to the following, and generate the lockfile with `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=your-resolve-name`:

``` toml
# pants.toml

[python.resolves]
...
your-resolve-name = "3rdparty/python/your-resolve-name.lock"

[black]
install_from_resolve = "your-resolve-name"
```

``` python
# BUILD
python_requirement(name="black", resolve="your-resolve-name", requirements=["black>=23,<24"])
```

#### Terraform

Bugfix: fixed an issue with cache concurrency. This affected initialization of modules without lockfiles (for example, with the `check` goal) and the generation of lockfiles. ([#21805](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/21805))

#### Shell

The previously deprecated `[shell-setup].tailor` option has now been removed. See [`[shell-setup].tailor_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell-setup#tailor_sources) and [`[shell-setup].tailor_shunit2_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/reference/subsystems/shell#tailor_shunit2_tests) to update.

### Plugin API changes

The version of Python used by Pants itself is now [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) (up from 3.9).

The oldest [glibc version](https://www.sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) supported by the published Pants wheels is now 2.28. This should have no effect unless you are running on extremely old Linux distributions. See <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux> for background context on Python wheels and C libraries.

The integration testing framework in the `pantsbuild.pants.testutil` package now supports streaming the output of the Pants invocation under test to the console. This is useful when debugging long-running integration tests which would otherwise show no output while they run since the integration test framework previously only captured output to a buffer. To use, adjust specific test(s) to use the new `stream_output` parameter, for example, `run_pants_with_workdir(..., stream_output=True)` or `run_pants(..., stream_output=True)`, and then run the test with `pants test --debug path/to:test -- --capture=no` so the test is invoked as an interactive process and pytest does not capture the output during the run.
