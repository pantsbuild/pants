# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization,
and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was
established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is
[sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

#### Remote Caching/Execution

Pants now sends a `user-agent` header with every request to a remote store or a remote execution service,
even when other headers are configured. If necessary, the user may override the user agent by specifying
one in `remote_store_headers` or `remote_execution_headers`.

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Goals

### Backends

### Plugin API changes
