# 2.25.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization,
and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was
established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is
[sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

### New Options System

The "legacy" options system is removed in this release. All options parsing is now handled by the new, native parser.

### Goals

### Backends

### Plugin API changes

The oldest [glibc version](https://www.sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) supported by the published Pants wheels is now 2.28.  This should have no effect unless you are running on extremely old Linux distributions.  See <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux> for background context on Python wheels and C libraries.
