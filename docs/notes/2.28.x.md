# 2.28.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

### General

The `run_rule_with_mocks()` test helper function, used to test `@rule`s both in the Pants codebase and
in third party plugin code, has been updated to support call-by-name. Several longstanding bugs
in that function were also fixed.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Docker

Added an option to [the `[docker]` subsystem](https://www.pantsbuild.org/prerelease/reference/subsystems/docker) to allow
bypassing the `suggest_renames` functionality. There are currently situations where this code path can
[introduce performance degradation](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22246), and this flag allows the end user to work around that issue.

### Plugin API changes
