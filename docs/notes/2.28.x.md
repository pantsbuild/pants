# 2.28.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

The plugin API introduces polymorphic rules, which support runtime polymorphism with @rule call-by-name semantics.

### Deprecations

### General

### Goals

### Backends

#### Python

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to v2.40.1.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20250610`.

Protobuf: See protobuf backend section for information about the new `[python-protobuf].generate_type_stubs` option.

#### Javascript

Added support for using typescript targets, e.g. `typescript_source` or `tsx_source` for javascript goals like `test`
and `package`.

Dependency inference now uses tsx grammar, allowing Pants to infer type imports and more robustly parse jsx, tsx, and ts files.

tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json "extends" are now correctly parsed from the top-level json object, rather than the compilerOptions object.

Added internal support for executing a NodeJS tool where the executable name is different to the package, to support typescript/tsc.

Added new build file alias `node_run_script` to allow generating node script targets that are not tied to packaging and can be executed via the `run` goal.


#### Docker

Added an option to [the `[docker]` subsystem](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.28/reference/subsystems/docker) to allow bypassing the `suggest_renames` functionality. There are currently situations where this code path can [introduce performance degradation](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/22246), and this flag allows the end user to work around that issue.

When using `--keep-sandboxes=always` or `--keep-sandboxes=on-failure`, the `__run.sh` script in the preserved exexecution sandbox was generated incorrectly because it was generated as if local execution were applicable. The `__run.sh` is now generated so that it invokes Docker to start the relevant container and invoke the process inside the container.

#### Protobuf (Python)

The new `[python-protobuf].generate_type_stubs` option configures `protoc` to directly generate type stubs which has been supported in recent versions of `protoc` for some time. This option should be preferred over the `[python-protobuf].mypy_plugin` option.

### Remote caching/execution

Pants now experimentally supports batch reads from the gRPC Remote Execution API. Set [the `[GLOBAL].remote_store_batch_load_enabled` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.28/reference/global-options#remote_store_batch_load_enabled) to enable it. Batched reads can significantly increase throughput when many small files are being read.


#### Scala

Add an option to the `[scalac]` subsystem to allow configure different args for scalac per resolve.

### Plugin API changes

This release introduces "polymorphic rules", which are how we implement runtime polymorphism with
call-by-name semantics. This is intended to replace [union Gets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.28/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/union-rules-advanced).

The `run_rule_with_mocks()` test helper function, used to test `@rule`s both in the Pants codebase and
in third party plugin code, has been updated to support call-by-name. Several longstanding bugs
in that function were also fixed.

PyO3, the interface crate between Rust and Python, has been upgraded to v0.25.0.
