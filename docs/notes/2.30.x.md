# 2.30.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

### Deprecations

The deprecation period for the `experimental_test_shell_command` alias has expired, use `test_shell_command` going forward.

### General

Add support for custom resource definitions to the k8s-parser. This allows users to define custom Kubernetes resources in their codebase, which can then be parsed and used by Pants.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

The default version of the helm-unittest tool has been upgraded from `0.8.0` to [`1.0.1`](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

#### JVM

#### Python

The Ruff tool has been upgraded from 0.12.5 to [0.13.0](https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.13.0) by default.

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to `v2.57.0`


#### Javascript

#### TypeScript

### Plugin API changes

Pants now supports mutual recursion between rules using call-by-name semantics. That is, you can
now have `rule1()` and `rule2()` invoke each other by name. This only works if `rule1()` and
`rule2() are both defined at the top level of the same module.
