# 2.30.x Release Series

Pants is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier support through throughout this release.

## What's New

### Highlights

Python lockfile metadata can now be stored in a sibling file to the lockfile, instead of as a prepended header in the lockfile itself.

### Deprecations

The plugin API's `Get()` construct has been deprecated in favor of the call-by-name idiom. See [here](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) for how to update your plugins.

The deprecation period for the `experimental_test_shell_command` alias has expired, use `test_shell_command` going forward.

Since 2023 Pants has included a rudimentary experimental backend for Rust.  The functionality was mostly limited to running `rustfmt` and no further development has occurred.  This backend is deprecated in 2.30 and will be removed in 2.31.

We would love to see sustained support for Rust in Pants! If you're interested in contributing, please read through and comment onhttps://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/20119.

### General

Add support for custom resource definitions to the k8s-parser. This allows users to define custom Kubernetes resources in their codebase, which can then be parsed and used by Pants.

### Goals

### Backends

#### Helm

The default version of the helm-unittest tool has been upgraded from `0.8.0` to [`1.0.1`](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

The default version of kubeconform has been upgraded from `0.6.7` to [`0.7.0`](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/tag/v0.7.0).

#### JVM

#### Python

Python lockfile metadata can now be stored in a sibling file to the lockfile, instead of as a prepended header in the lockfile itself. This makes it easier to work with the same lockfile directly with Pex. Set `[python].separate_lockfile_metadata_file = true` in `pants.toml` to enable. This will become the default in the future, and will eventually be required, so we recommend opting in to this at your convenience.

The Python Build Standalone backend (`pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.python_build_standalone`) has release metadata current through PBS release `20251014`.  This includes support for Python 3.14.

The Ruff tool has been upgraded from 0.12.5 to [0.13.0](https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.13.0) by default.

The version of [Pex](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex) used by the Python backend has been upgraded to [`v2.61.1`](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.61.1).  Among other changes and bugfixes, this includes support for the Python 3.15 alpha series.

The Pex `--source` option is now plumbed through to the Python resolve subsystem. This can be used to scope indexes or find-links repos to only be used to resolve certain projects, environments or a combination of the two, see [here](https://github.com/pex-tool/pex/releases/tag/v2.56.0).

#### Shell

Added a new `package_shell_command` target type to allow shell commands to be invoked from the `package` goal to produce built artifacts.

#### Javascript

Added support for typechecking typescript and javascript files with the `check` goal.

#### TypeScript

Added support for running TypeScript and TSX test files with the `pants test` goal.

#### Go

Performance has been improved for dependency download and analysis.

### Plugin API changes

The plugin API's `Get()` construct has been deprecated in favor of the call-by-name idiom. See [here](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/migrating-gets) for how to update your plugins.

Pants now supports mutual recursion between rules using call-by-name semantics. That is, you can now have `rule1()` and `rule2()` invoke each other by name. This only works if `rule1()` and `rule2() are both defined at the top level of the same module.
