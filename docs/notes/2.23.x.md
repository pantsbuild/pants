# 2.23.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights


### Goals


### Backends

#### Scala

Source files no longer produce a dependency on Scala plugins. If you are using a Scala plugin that is also required by the source code (such as acyclic), please add an explicit dependency or set the `packages` field on the artifact.

#### Python

[The `pants.backend.experimental.python.typecheck.pyright` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.23/reference/subsystems/pyright) now uses version 1.1.365 by default.

#### JavaScript

Two issues with pants `corepack` integration has been resolved:
1. The `"packageManager"` package.json field is now respected for other package.json than the one at the build root.
Previously, if for example a nodejs tool was configured with a resolve based off of such a package.json, the bug caused
pants to invoke `corepack`s default versions of the package managers instead.
2. The pants.toml option `[nodejs].package_manager` can now be assigned any of the supported package managers
(npm, pnpm, yarn) without providing a corresponding `[nodejs].package_managers` version setting. The version is then
entirely handled by `corepack`. Previously this mode caused pants to fail.

### Plugin API changes

Fixed bug with workspace environment support where Pants used a workspace environment when it was searching for a local environment.
