# 2.23.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights


### Goals


### Backends

#### NEW: Trufflehog

A new experimental `pants.backend.experimental.tools.trufflehog` backend was added to support
[`trufflehog`](https://trufflesecurity.com/trufflehog) secret scanning. The backend supports ignoring certain paths by adding, for example:
```
[trufflehog]
exclude = ["**/tests/*"]
```

The backend linter will also load a Trufflehog [configuration file](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog?tab=readme-ov-file#regex-detector-example) (passed via `trufflehog -c trufflehog-config.yaml`), as long as the configuration file is placed in the root of your codebase with filename: `trufflehog-config.yaml`

### Plugin API changes
