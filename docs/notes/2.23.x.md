# 2.23.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights


### Goals


### Backends

#### BUILD

Support for parametrizing grouped parametrizations. (e.g. `**parametrize(resolve=parametrize("a", "b"), ...)`). This works for `___defaults__` as well, as long as it is specified per target type rather than using `all`.

#### Scala

Source files no longer produce a dependency on Scala plugins. If you are using a Scala plugin that is also required by the source code (such as acyclic), please add an explicit dependency or set the `packages` field on the artifact.

#### Python

[The `pants.backend.experimental.python.typecheck.pyright` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.23/reference/subsystems/pyright) now uses version 1.1.365 by default.

### Plugin API changes

Fixed bug with workspace environment support where Pants used a workspace environment when it was searching for a local environment.
