1.15.x Stable Releases
======================
This document describes releases leading up to the ``1.15.x`` ``stable`` series.


1.15.0 (4/15/2019)
------------------

The first stable release of the `1.15.x` series, with no changes since `rc3`!

This is the first Pants version to support being run under either Python 3.6 or 2.7. If you've been
using our provided `./pants` script prior to this release, update the script by
running `curl -L -O https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup/pants`. Pants 1.17.0 will no longer support
running Pants with Python 2.7 and will require Python 3.6+.

1.15.0rc3 (4/08/2019)
---------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Pass interpreter constraints to the Pex we release (#7511)
  `PR #7511 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/7511>`_

Refactoring, Improvements, and Tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install Python 2.7 and 3.6 on Centos6 base image through Pyenv (#7064)
  `PR #7064 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/7064>`_

* Prepare Linux UCS2 shard for upgrade to Centos6 base image in #7064 (#7418)
  `PR #7418 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/7418>`_

1.15.0rc2 (4/02/2019)
---------------------

As of this release, Pants has reached implementation and performance parity when running under
Python 3 and Python 2! Although Python 3.7 will not be supported in the 1.15.x series, Python 3.6 can
now be considered a stable platform for running Pants.
