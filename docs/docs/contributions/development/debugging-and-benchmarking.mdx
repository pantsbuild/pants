Some techniques to figure out why Pants is behaving the way it is.

---

## Benchmarking with `hyperfine`

We use `hyperfine` to benchmark, especially comparing before and after to see the impact of a change: [https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

When benchmarking, you must decide if you care about cold cache performance vs. warm cache (or both). If cold, use `--no-pantsd --no-local-cache`. If warm, use hyperfine's option `--warmup=1`.

For example:

```
❯ hyperfine --warmup=1 --runs=5 'pants list ::`
❯ hyperfine --runs=5 'pants --no-pantsd --no-local-cache lint ::'
```

## CPU profiling with py-spy

`py-spy` is a profiling sampler which can also be used to compare the impact of a change before and after: [https://github.com/benfred/py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy).

To profile with `py-spy`:

1. Activate Pants' development venv
   - `source ~/.cache/pants/pants_dev_deps/<your platform dir>/bin/activate`
2. Install `py-spy` into it
   - `pip install py-spy`
3. Run Pants with `py-spy` (be sure to disable `pantsd`)
   - `PYTHONPATH=src/python NO_SCIE_WARNING=1 py-spy record --subprocesses -- python -m pants.bin.pants_loader --no-pantsd <pants args>`
   - If you're running Pants from sources on code in another repo, set `PYTHONPATH` to the `src/python` dir in the pants repo, and set `PANTS_VERSION` to the current dev version in that repo.
   - On MacOS you may have to run this as root, under `sudo`.

The default output is a flamegraph. `py-spy` can also output speedscope ([https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope)) JSON with the `--format speedscope` flag. The resulting file can be uploaded to [https://www.speedscope.app/](https://www.speedscope.app/) which provides a per-process, interactive, detailed UI.

Additionally, to profile the Rust code the `--native` flag can be passed to `py-spy` as well. The resulting output will contain frames from Pants Rust code.

## Memory profiling with memray

`memray` is a Python memory profiler that can also track allocation in native extension modules: [https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/](https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/).

To profile with `memray`:

1. Activate Pants' development venv
   - `source ~/.cache/pants/pants_dev_deps/<your platform dir>/bin/activate`
2. Install `memray` into it
   - `pip install memray`
3. Run Pants with `memray`
   - `PYTHONPATH=src/python NO_SCIE_WARNING=1 memray run --native -o output.bin -m pants.bin.pants_loader --no-pantsd <pants args>`
   - If you're running Pants from sources on code in another repo, set `PYTHONPATH` to the `src/python` dir in the pants repo, and set `PANTS_VERSION` to the current dev version in that repo.

Note that in many cases it will be easier and more useful to run Pants with the `--stats-memory-summary` flag.

## Debugging `rule` code with a debugger in VSCode

Running pants with the `PANTS_DEBUG` environment variable set will use `debugpy` ([https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy))
to start a Debug-Adapter server ([https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)) which will
wait for a client connection before running Pants.

You can connect any Debug-Adapter-compliant editor (Such as VSCode) as a client, and use breakpoints,
inspect variables, run code in a REPL, and break-on-exceptions in your `rule` code.

NOTE: `PANTS_DEBUG` doesn't work with the pants daemon, so `--no-pantsd` must be specified.

## Debugging `rule` code with a debugger in PyCharm

You'll have to follow a different procedure until PyCharm adds Debug-Adapter support:

1. Add a requirement on `pydevd-pycharm` in your local clone of the pants source in [3rdparty/python/requirements.txt](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/main/3rdparty/python/requirements.txt)
2. Add this snippet where you want to break:

```python
import pydevd_pycharm
pydevd_pycharm.settrace('localhost', port=5000, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)
```

3. Start a remote debugging session
4. Run pants from your clone. The build will automatically install the new requirement. For example:

```
example-python$ PANTS_SOURCE=<path_to_your_pants_clone> pants --no-pantsd test ::
```

## Obtaining Full Thread Backtraces

Pants runs as a Python program that calls into a native Rust library. In debugging locking and deadlock issues, it is useful to capture dumps of the thread stacks in order to figure out where a deadlock may be occurring.

One-time setup:

1. Ensure that gdb is installed.
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gdb`
2. Ensure that the kernel is configured to allow debuggers to attach to processes that are not in the same parent/child process hierarchy.
   - `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`
   - To make the change permanent, add a file to /etc/sysctl.d named `99-ptrace.conf` with contents `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0`. **Note: This is a security exposure if you are not normally debugging processes across the process hierarchy.**
3. Ensure that the debug info for your system Python binary is installed.
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-dbg`

Dumping thread stacks:

1. Find the pants binary (which may include pantsd if pantsd is enabled).
   - Run: `ps -ef | grep pants`
2. Invoke gdb with the python binary and the process ID:
   - Run: `gdb /path/to/python/binary PROCESS_ID`
3. Enable logging to write the thread dump to `gdb.txt`: `set logging on`
4. Dump all thread backtraces: `thread apply all bt`
5. If you use pyenv to manage your Python install, a gdb script will exist in the same directory as the Python binary. Source it into gdb:
   - `source ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5/bin/python3.8-gdb.py` (if using version 3.8.5)
6. Dump all Python stacks: `thread apply all py-bt`
