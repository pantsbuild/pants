Package manager lockfile integration

---

Third-party dependencies are specified in the package.json fields.
All package managers vendors a lockfile format specific for the package manager you are using. Pants knows of this
lockfile and models it as a "resolve".

Resolves is the only way to deal with dependencies within pants, and no extra configuration is required.

You can however name your resolves/lockfiles. The resolve name is otherwise auto-generated.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages.add = [
    "pants.backend.experimental.javascript"
]

[nodejs.resolves]
package-lock.json = "my-lock"

```

You generate the lockfile as follows:

```shell title="Bash"
$ pants generate-lockfiles
19:00:39.26 [INFO] Completed: Generate lockfile for my-lock
19:00:39.29 [INFO] Wrote lockfile for the resolve `my-lock` to package-lock.json
```


## Using lockfiles for tools

To ensure that the same version of tooling you have specified in `package.json` is used with a NodeJS powered tool,
specify the resolve name for the tool.
E.g., for the Prettier linter:

```toml tab={"label": "pants.toml"}
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages.add = [
    "pants.backend.experimental.javascript",
    "pants.backend.experimental.javascript.lint.prettier",
]

[prettier]
install_from_resolve = "nodejs-default"

```
```json tab={"label": "package.json"}
{
    "name": "@my-company/pkg",
    "devDependencies": {
        "prettier": "^2.6.2"
    }
}
```
```python tab={"label": "BUILD"}
    package_json(name="pkg")
```
