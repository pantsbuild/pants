Package manager workspace management

---

Modern versions of package managers introduce similar
concepts of "workspaces", a list of Nodejs packages all contained within the same code repository.

Pants support all three flavors of package managers and understands the configuration
settings specific for each tool:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) pnpm-workspaces.yaml
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/workspaces)
    "workspaces" setting in package.json

:::tip Use workspaces!
It is encouraged by the Pants team to utilize this project setup to only have to deal with and maintain
one [resolve](./lockfiles.mdx). Pants aims to provide full integration with these monorepo settings.
