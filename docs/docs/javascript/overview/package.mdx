package.json parsing and scripts integration

---

As mentioned in the [overview introduction](./index.mdx), Pants's approach to enable support for Javascript is to
be a thin caching layer on top of your current tooling.

Refer to the [example repository](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-javascript) for example usage.

### Package manager

Pants uses `corepack` to manage package manager versions and installation. Like `corepack`, Pants respects
the experimental "packageManager" feature in `package.json` files.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "name": "@my-company/pkg",
    "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.22"
}
```

this setting will ensure that all scripts invoked for this package.json, and any
[workspaces managed by this package.json](./workspaces.mdx) will use this particular version of `yarn`.
It can be more convenient to define a project level
[package manager](./enabling-javascript-support.mdx#setting-up-a-package-manager).

:::tip Choosing between `pants.toml` or `package.json` for package manager version configuration
In general, if your team runs all tooling via Pants, using `pants.toml` reduces boilerplate in cases where you maintain
multiple packages. If your team mixes usage of Pants and "bare" package manager invocations, package.json#packageManager
is the safer option.
:::

### Testing

By default Pants assumes a `package_json` target mapping a `package.json` includes a test script, e.g.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "name": "@my-company/pkg",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "jest": "^29.5.0"
    }
}
```

and will use this script to execute your tests when running `pants test ::`.
See [Goal arguments](../../using-pants/key-concepts/goals.mdx#goal-arguments) for the normal techniques for telling Pants what to
run on.

To enable configurability, the build symbol [`node_test_script`](../../../reference/build-file-symbols/node_test_script)
contains options for changing the entry point from "test", and to enable coverage reporting.

### Packaging

Similarly, build scripts can be introduced to Pants via the
[`node_build_script`](../../../reference/build-file-symbols/node_build_script) build symbol. This is intended to be used
as a way to introduce artifacts generated via bundlers and/or compilers installed and ran via your package manager.
The result can the be consumed by other targets as either `resource`-targets that can be depended on,
or as a package for the [docker backend](../../docker/index.mdx).
