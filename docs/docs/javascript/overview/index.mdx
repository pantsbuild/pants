Pants's support for Javascript.

:::caution Javascript support is beta stage
We are done implementing most functionality for Pants's Javascript support
([tracked here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/labels/backend%3A%20javascript)).
However, there may be use cases that we aren't yet handling.
:::

The Javascript and NodeJS ecosystem has a seemingly endless amounts of frameworks and tooling,
all orchestrated via package managers.

Pants employs a wrapping approach with a thin caching layer applied on top of current supported package managers:
`npm`, `pnpm` and `yarn`.

Features for Javascript:

- Caching the results of your test scripts and build scripts,
 making the latter available in your pants workflows as [`resources`](../../reference/targets/resource) and
 package artifacts.
- A consistent interface for all languages/tools in your repository,
 such as being able to run `pants fmt lint check test package`.
- [Remote execution and remote caching](../../using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/index.mdx).
- [Advanced project introspection](../../using-pants/project-introspection.mdx),
 such as finding all code that transitively depends on a certain package.
