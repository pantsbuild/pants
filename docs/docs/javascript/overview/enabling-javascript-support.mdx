How to enable Pants's bundled Javascript backend package.

---

:::note Example Javascript repository
See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-javascript) for examples of Pants's Javascript functionality.

:::

### Configuring the repository

Enable the experimental Javascript [backend](../../using-pants/key-concepts/backends.mdx) like this:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
    "pants.backend.experimental.javascript"
]
```

Pants uses [`package_json`](../../../reference/targets/package_json.mdx) targets to model a NodeJS package.
Further, [`javascript_source`](../../../reference/targets/javascript_source.mdx) and
[`javascript_tests`](../../../reference/targets/javascript_test.mdx) targets are used to know which Javascript files to
run on and to set any metadata.

You can generate these targets by running [`pants tailor ::`](../../getting-started/initial-configuration.mdx#5-generate-build-files).

```
‚ùØ pants tailor ::
Created project/BUILD:
  - Add javascript_sources target project
  - Add javascript_tests target tests
```

:::tip Improved inference and introspection for bundled projects
For [dependency inference](../../introduction/how-does-pants-work.mdx#dependency-inference), Pants reads both your
projects' `package.json` sections and additionally
supports [`jsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig), if one is present.
:::

### Setting up node
Pants will by default download a distribution of `node` according to the
[`nodejs` subsystem](../../../reference/subsystems/nodejs) configuration. If you wish to instead use a locally installed
 version of, for example, 18.0.0 using `nvm` and its `.nvmrc` file, the following will get you there:

```toml tab={"label": "pants.toml"}
[nodejs]
known_versions = [] # Assign this to the empty list to ensure Pants never downloads.
version = "v18.0.0"
search_path = ["<NVM_LOCAL>"]

```

```txt tab={"label": ".nvmrc"}
v18.0.0

```

### Setting up a package manager
To set a package manager project wide, do the following:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[nodejs]
package_manager = "pnpm" # or yarn, or npm.

```

you can instead opt to use the [`package.json#packageManager`](./package.mdx#package-manager) field for this setting.
Regardless of setting, pants uses the [`corepack`](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) version distributed with the Node
version you have chosen to install and manage package managers.
