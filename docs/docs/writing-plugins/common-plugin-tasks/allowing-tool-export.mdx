How to make a tool exportable with the `export` goal.

---

Backends that implement the `export` goal can indicate binaries that should be exported. These will have their contents exported to a subfolder in the `dist/bins` directory, and the binary itself will be linked in `dist/bin`.

## Downloadable Tools

Subclasses of `ExternalTool` (including `TemplatedExternalTool`) have the logic for exporting implemented. Tools are marked for export as follows:

1. Implement `ExternalTool.generate_exe` if the default is not correct. For instance, a tool downloaded might include a binary, a readme, and a license. This method will point to the binary within the downloaded files.

2. Register a `UnionRule` with `ExportableTool`. For example, `UnionRule(ExportableTool, FortranLint)`

## Implementing for new backends

Backends need to implement:

1. A subclass of `ExportRequest`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExportExternalToolRequest(ExportRequest):
    pass
```

2. A rule from this subclass to `ExportResults`

```python
@rule
async def export_external_tools(
    request: ExportExternalToolRequest, export: ExportSubsystem
) -> ExportResults:
```

3. Inside of that rule, fill the `ExportResult.exported_binaries` field.

```python
ExportResult(
    description=f"Export tool {req.resolve}",
    reldir=dest,
    digest=downloaded_tool.digest,
    resolve=req.resolve,
    exported_binaries=(ExportedBinary(name=Path(exe).name, path_in_export=exe),),
)
```

4. For every tool, mark it for export registering a `UnionRule` with `ExportableTool`.

```python
def rules():
    return [
        ...,
        UnionRule(ExportableTool, FortranLint),
    ]
```
