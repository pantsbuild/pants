How to add lockfiles and the `generate-lockfiles` goal.

---
Lockfiles are a way to pin to exact versions of dependencies, often including hashes to guarantee integrity between the version pinned and the version downloaded.

This guide will walk you through implementing lockfiles and hooking them into the `generate-lockfiles` goal. It assumes that your language has a tool that supports generating and using lockfiles or that you have written code which does these.

## 1. Expose your lockfiles to Pants

Create subclasses of `KnownUserResolveNamesRequest` to inform Pants about which resolves exist, and a subclass of `RequestedUserResolveNames` for Pants to request those resolves later. Implement the resolve-finding logic in a Rule from your subclass of `KnownUserResolveNamesRequest` to `KnownUserResolveNames`. Set `KnownResolveNames.requested_resolve_names_cls` to your subclass of `RequestedUserResolveNames`. 

```python tab={"label": "pants-plugins/fortran/lockfiles.py"}
from pants.core.goals.generate_lockfiles import KnownUserResolveNamesRequest, RequestedUserResolveNames, KnownUserResolveNames
from pants.engine.rules import rule
from pants.engine.target import AllTargets


class KnownFortranResolveNamesRequest(KnownUserResolveNamesRequest):
    pass


class RequestedFortranResolveNames(RequestedUserResolveNames):
    pass


@rule
async def identify_user_resolves_from_fortran_files(
        _: KnownFortranResolveNamesRequest,
        all_targets: AllTargets,
) -> KnownUserResolveNames:
    ...
    return KnownUserResolveNames(
        ...,
        requested_resolve_names_cls=RequestedFortranResolveNames
    )
```

## 2. Connect resolve names to requests to generate lockfiles

Create a subclass of `GenerateLockfile`. Pants will use this to represent a lockfile to generate. Then create a rule from your subclass of `RequestedUserResolveNames` to `UserGenerateLockfiles`. Pants will use this rule to convert from a user's request to export a resolve by name into the information needed to export the resolve.

```python tab={"label": "pants-plugins/fortran/lockfiles.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pants.backend.fortran.target_types import FortranDeploymentTarget
from pants.core.goals.generate_lockfiles import GenerateLockfile, UserGenerateLockfiles
from pants.engine.rules import rule


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class GenerateFortranLockfile(GenerateLockfile):
    target: FortranDeploymentTarget


@rule
async def setup_user_lockfile_requests(
        requested: RequestedFortranResolveNames,
) -> UserGenerateLockfiles:
    ...
    return UserGenerateLockfiles(
        [
            GenerateFortranLockfile(
                ...
            )
        ]
    )
```

## 3. Generate lockfiles

Create a rule from your subclass of `GenerateLockfile` to `GenerateLockfileResult`. This rule generates the lockfile. In the common case that you're running a process to generate this lockfile, you can use the `Process.output_files` to gather those files from the execution sandbox.

```python tab={"label": "pants-plugins/fortran/lockfiles.py"}
from pants.backend.fortran.tool import FortranProcess
from pants.core.goals.generate_lockfiles import GenerateLockfileResult
from pants.engine.internals.selectors import Get
from pants.engine.process import ProcessResult
from pants.engine.rules import rule


@rule
async def generate_lockfile_from_sources(
        request: GenerateFortranLockfile,
) -> GenerateLockfileResult:
    ...

    result = await Get(
        ProcessResult,
        FortranProcess(...),
    )

    return GenerateLockfileResult(result.output_digest, request.resolve_name, request.lockfile_dest)

```

## 4. Register rules

At the bottom of the file, let Pants know what your rules and types do. Update your plugin's `register.py` to tell Pants about them/

```python tab={"label": "pants-plugins/fortran/lockfiles.py"}


from pants.core.goals.generate_lockfiles import GenerateLockfile, KnownUserResolveNamesRequest, RequestedUserResolveNames
from pants.engine.rules import collect_rules
from pants.engine.unions import UnionRule


def rules():
    return (
        *collect_rules(),
        UnionRule(GenerateLockfile, GenerateFortranLockfile),
        UnionRule(KnownUserResolveNamesRequest, KnownFortranResolveNamesRequest),
        UnionRule(RequestedUserResolveNames, RequestedFortranResolveNames),
    )
```

```python tab={"label": "pants-plugins/fortran/register.py"}
from fortran import lockfiles

def rules():
    return [
        ...,
        *lockfiles.rules()
    ]
```

## 5. Use lockfiles for fetching dependencies

If you have a tool that supports lockfiles, the easiest way to get the lockfile to it is to simply use a glob to pull the file into a digest.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from pants.engine.fs import PathGlobs
from pants.engine.internals.native_engine import Snapshot
from pants.engine.internals.selectors import Get
from pants.engine.rules import rule


@rule
async def init_fortran(request: FortranInitRequest) -> FortranInitResponse:
    ...
    Get(Snapshot, PathGlobs([(Path(request.root_module.address.spec_path) / ".fortran.lock").as_posix()])),
```
