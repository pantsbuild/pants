How to add your own logic to `python_artifact()`.

---

Pants can build [Python distributions](../../python/python-overview/building-distributions.mdx), such as wheels and sdists, from information you provide in a [`python_distribution`](../../../reference/targets/python_distribution.mdx) target.

When doing so, and if you don't provide your own `setup.py` file, Pants generates one and passes it the kwargs provided in the `provides=python_artifact(...)` field to the `setup(...)` call (Pants also generates some of the kwargs, such as `install_requires` and `namespace_packages` by analyzing your code).

It's fairly common to want to generate more of the kwargs dynamically. For example, you may want to:

- Reduce boilerplate by not repeating common kwargs across BUILD files.
- Read from the file system to dynamically determine kwargs, such as the `long_description` or `version`.
- Run processes like `git` to dynamically determine kwargs like `version`.

You can write a plugin to add custom kwarg generation logic.

Note: there may only be at most one applicable plugin per target customizing the kwargs for the `setup()` function.

:::note Example
See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/pants-plugins/internal_plugins/releases/register.py) for an example that Pants uses internally for its `python_distribution` targets. This plugin demonstrates reading from the file system to set the `version` and `long_description` kwargs, along with adding hardcoded kwargs.
:::

1. Set up a subclass of `SetupKwargsRequest`

---

Set the class method `is_applicable()` to determine whether your implementation should be used for the particular `python_distribution` target. If `False`, Pants will use the default implementation which simply uses the explicitly provided `python_artifact` from the BUILD file.

In this example, we will always use our custom implementation:

```python
from pants.backend.python.util_rules.package_dists import SetupKwargsRequest
from pants.engine.target import Target

class CustomSetupKwargsRequest(SetupKwargsRequest):
    @classmethod
    def is_applicable(cls, _: Target) -> bool:
        return True
```

This example will only use our plugin implementation for `python_distribution` targets defined in the folder `src/python/project1`.

```python
class CustomSetupKwargsRequest(SetupKwargsRequest):
    @classmethod
    def is_applicable(cls, target: Target) -> bool:
        return target.address.spec.startswith("src/python/project1")
```

Then, register your new `SetupKwargsRequest ` with a [`UnionRule`](../the-rules-api/union-rules-advanced.mdx) so that Pants knows your implementation exists:

```python
from pants.engine.rules import collect_rules
from pants.engine.unions import UnionRule

...

def rules():
    return [
      	*collect_rules(),
        UnionRule(SetupKwargsRequest, CustomSetupKwargsRequest),
    ]
```

:::note Consider defining custom `python_distribution` target types
If you don't want to always use a single custom implementation, an effective approach could be to create custom `python_distribution` target types so that your users decide which implementation they want to use in their BUILD files.

For example, a user could do this:

```python
pants_python_distribution(
name="my-dist",
dependencies=[...],
provides=python_artifact(...)
)

pants_contrib_python_distribution(
name="my-dist",
dependencies=[...],
provides=python_artifact(...)
)
```

To support this workflow, [create new target types](../the-target-api/creating-new-targets.mdx).

```python
class PantsPythonDistribution(Target):
alias = "pants_python_distribution"
core_fields = PythonDistribution.core_fields

class PantsContribPythonDistribution(Target):
alias = "pants_contrib_python_distribution"
core_fields = PythonDistribution.core_fields
```

Then, for each `SetupKwargsRequest` subclass, check which target type was used:

```python
class PantsSetupKwargsRequest(SetupKwargsRequest):
@classmethod
def is_applicable(cls, target: Target) -> bool:
return isinstance(target, PantsPythonDistribution)
```

:::

2. Create a rule with your logic

---

Your rule should take as a parameter the `SetupKwargsRequest ` from step 1. This type has two fields: `target: Target` and `explicit_kwargs: dict[str, Any]`. You can use these fields to get more information on the target you are generating a `setup.py` for.

Your rule should return `SetupKwargs`, which takes two arguments: `kwargs: dict[str, Any]` and `address: Address`.

For example, this will simply hardcode a kwarg:

```python
from pants.backend.python.util_rules.package_dists import SetupKwargs
from pants.engine.rules import rule

@rule
async def setup_kwargs_plugin(request: CustomSetupKwargsRequest) -> SetupKwargs:
    return SetupKwargs(
        {**request.explicit_kwargs, "plugin_demo": "hello world"}, address=request.target.address
    )
```

Update your plugin's `register.py` to activate this file's rules.

```python title="pants-plugins/python_plugins/register.py"
from python_plugins import custom_python_artifact

def rules():
   return custom_python_artifact.rules()
```

Then, run `pants package path/to:python_distribution` and inspect the generated `setup.py`to confirm that your plugin worked correctly.

Often, you will want to read from a file in your project to set kwargs like `version` or `long_description`. Use `await Get(DigestContents, PathGlobs)` to do this (see [File system](../the-rules-api/file-system.mdx)):

```python
from pants.backend.python.util_rules.package_dists import SetupKwargs
from pants.engine.fs import DigestContents, GlobMatchErrorBehavior, PathGlobs
from pants.engine.rules import rule

@rule
async def setup_kwargs_plugin(request: CustomSetupKwargsRequest) -> SetupKwargs:
    digest_contents = await Get(
        DigestContents,
        PathGlobs(
            ["project/ABOUT.rst"],
            description_of_origin="`python_artifact()` plugin",
            glob_match_error_behavior=GlobMatchErrorBehavior.error,
        ),
    )
    about_page_content = digest_contents[0].content.decode()
    return SetupKwargs(
        {**request.explicit_kwargs, "long_description": "\n".join(about_page_content)},
        address=request.target.address
    )
```

It can be helpful to allow users to add additional kwargs to their BUILD files for you to consume in your plugin. For example, this plugin adds a custom `long_description_path` field, which gets popped and replaced by the plugin with a normalized `long_description` kwarg:

```python
python_distribution(
    name="mydist",
    dependencies=[...],
    provides=python_artifact(
        name="mydist",
        ...
        long_description_path="README.md",
    ),
    generate_setup = True,
    sdist = False,
)
```

```python
import os.path

from pants.backend.python.util_rules.package_dists import SetupKwargs
from pants.engine.fs import DigestContents, GlobMatchErrorBehavior, PathGlobs
from pants.engine.rules import rule

@rule
async def setup_kwargs_plugin(request: CustomSetupKwargsRequest) -> SetupKwargs:
    original_kwargs = request.explicit_kwargs.copy()
    long_description_relpath = original_kwargs.pop("long_description_file", None)
    if not long_description_relpath:
        raise ValueError(
            f"The python_distribution target {request.target.address} did not include "
            "`long_description_file` in its python_artifact's kwargs. Our plugin requires this! "
            "Please set to a path relative to the BUILD file, e.g. `ABOUT.md`."
        )

    build_file_path = request.target.address.spec_path
    long_description_path = os.path.join(build_file_path, long_description_relpath)
    digest_contents = await Get(
        DigestContents,
        PathGlobs(
            [long_description_path],
            description_of_origin=f"the 'long_description_file' kwarg in {request.target.address}",
            glob_match_error_behavior=GlobMatchErrorBehavior.error,
        ),
    )
    description_content = digest_contents[0].content.decode()
    return SetupKwargs(
        {**original_kwargs, "long_description": "\n".join(description_content)},
        address=request.target.address
    )
```

Refer to these guides for additional things you may want to do in your plugin:

- [Read from options](../the-rules-api/options-and-subsystems.mdx). Also see [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/pants-plugins/internal_plugins/releases/register.py) for an example.
- [Read values from the target](../the-rules-api/rules-and-the-target-api.mdx) using the Target API.
- [Run a `Process`](../the-rules-api/processes.mdx), such as `git`. Also see [Installing tools](../the-rules-api/installing-tools.mdx).
