Pants has helpers to make writing plugins easier.

## Python

### Lockfiles

The lockfiles for most Python tools fit into common categories. Pants has helpers to generate the rules for lockfile generation.

- A single Python package that could be installed with `pip install my_tool`

```python
from pants.backend.python.subsystems.python_tool_base import (
    LockfileRules,
    PythonToolBase,
)

class Isort(PythonToolBase):
    options_scope = "isort"
    ...
    lockfile_rules_type = LockfileRules.SIMPLE
```
