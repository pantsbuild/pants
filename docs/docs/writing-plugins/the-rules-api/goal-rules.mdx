How to create new goals.

---

For many [plugin tasks](../common-plugin-tasks/index.mdx), you will be extending existing goals, such as adding a new linter to the `lint` goal. However, you may instead want to create a new goal, such as a `publish` goal. This page explains how to create a new goal.

As explained in [Concepts](./concepts.mdx), `@goal_rule`s are the entry-point into the rule graph. When a user runs `pants my-goal`, the Pants engine will look for the respective `@goal_rule`. That `@goal_rule` will usually request other types, either as parameters in the `@goal_rule` signature or through `await Get`. But unlike a `@rule`, a `@goal_rule` may also trigger side effects (such as running interactive processes, writing to the filesystem, etc) via `await Effect`.

Often, you can keep all of your logic inline in the `@goal_rule`. As your `@goal_rule` gets more complex, you may end up factoring out helper `@rule`s, but you do not need to start with writing helper `@rule`s.

## How to register a new goal

There are four steps to creating a new [goal](../../using-pants/key-concepts/goals.mdx) with Pants:

1. Define a subclass of `GoalSubsystem`. This is the API to your goal.
   1. Set the class property `name` to the name of your goal.
   2. Set the class property `help`, which is used by `pants help`.
   3. You may register options through attributes of `pants.option.option_types` types. See [Options and subsystems](./options-and-subsystems.mdx).
2. Define a subclass of `Goal`. When a user runs `pants my-goal`, the engine will request your subclass, which is what causes the `@goal_rule` to run.
   1. Set the class property `subsystem_cls` to the `GoalSubsystem` from the previous step.
   2. A `Goal` takes a single argument in its constructor, `exit_code: int`. Pants will use this to determine what its own exit code should be.
3. Define an `@goal_rule`, which must return the `Goal` from the previous step and set its `exit_code`.
   1. For most goals, simply return `MyGoal(exit_code=0)`. Some goals like `lint` and `test` will instead propagate the error code from the tools they run.
4. Register the `@goal_rule` in a `register.py` file.

```python tab={"label":"pants-plugins/example/hello_world.py"}
from pants.engine.goal import Goal, GoalSubsystem
from pants.engine.rules import collect_rules, goal_rule


class HelloWorldSubsystem(GoalSubsystem):
    name = "hello-world"
    help = "An example goal."


class HelloWorld(Goal):
    subsystem_cls = HelloWorldSubsystem
    environment_behavior = Goal.EnvironmentBehavior.LOCAL_ONLY


@goal_rule
async def hello_world() -> HelloWorld:
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=1)


def rules():
    return collect_rules()
```

```python tab={"label":"pants-plugins/example/register.py"}
from example import hello_world

def rules():
    return [*hello_world.rules()]
```

You may now run `pants hello-world`, which should cause Pants to return with an error code of 1 (run `echo $?` to verify). Precisely, this causes the engine to request the type `HelloWorld`, which results in running the `@goal_rule` `hello_world`.

## `Console`: output to stdout/stderr

To output to the user, request the type `Console` as a parameter in your `@goal_rule`. This is a special type that may only be requested in `@goal_rules` and allows you to output to stdout and stderr.

```python
from pants.engine.console import Console
...

@goal_rule
async def hello_world(console: Console) -> HelloWorld:
    console.print_stdout("Hello!")
    console.print_stderr("Uh oh, an error.")
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=1)
```

### Using colors

You may output in color by using the methods `.blue()`, `.cyan()`, `.green()`, `.magenta()`, `.red()`, and `.yellow()`. The colors will only be used if the global option `--colors` is True.

```python
console.print_stderr(f"{console.red('𐄂')} Error encountered.")
```

### `Outputting` mixin (optional)

If your goal's purpose is to emit output, it may be helpful to use the mixin `Outputting`. This mixin will register the output `--output-file`, which allows the user to redirect the goal's stdout.

```python
from pants.engine.goal import Goal, GoalSubsystem, Outputting
from pants.engine.rules import goal_rule

class HelloWorldSubsystem(Outputting, GoalSubsystem):
    name = "hello-world"
    help = "An example goal."

...

@goal_rule
async def hello_world(
    console: Console, hello_world_subsystem: HelloWorldSubsystem
) -> HelloWorld:
    with hello_world_subsystem.output(console) as write_stdout:
        write_stdout("Hello world!")
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=0)
```

### `LineOriented` mixin (optional)

If your goal's purpose is to emit output -- and that output is naturally split by new lines -- it may be helpful to use the mixin `LineOriented`. This subclasses `Outputting`, so will register both the options `--output-file` and `--sep`, which allows the user to change the separator to not be `\n`.

```python
from pants.engine.goal import Goal, GoalSubsystem, LineOriented
from pants.engine.rules import goal_rule

class HelloWorldSubsystem(LineOriented, GoalSubsystem):
    name = "hello-world"
    help = "An example goal."

...

@goal_rule
async def hello_world(
    console: Console, hello_world_subsystem: HelloWorldSubsystem
) -> HelloWorld:
    with hello_world_subsystem.line_oriented(console) as print_stdout:
        print_stdout("0")
        print_stdout("1")
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=0)
```

## How to operate on Targets

Most goals will want to operate on targets. To do this, specify `Targets` as a parameter of your goal rule.

```python
from pants.engine.target import Targets
...

@goal_rule
async def hello_world(console: Console, targets: Targets) -> HelloWorld:
    for target in targets:
        console.print_stdout(target.address.spec)
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=0)
```

This example will print the address of any targets specified by the user, just as the `list` goal behaves.

```bash
$ pants hello-world helloworld/util::
helloworld/util
helloworld/util:tests
```

See [Rules and the Target API](./rules-and-the-target-api.mdx) for detailed information on how to use these targets in your rules, including accessing the metadata specified in BUILD files.

:::caution Common mistake: requesting the type of target you want in the `@goal_rule` signature
For example, if you are writing a `publish` goal, and you expect to operate on `python_distribution` targets, you might think to request `PythonDistribution` in your `@goal_rule` signature:

```python
@goal_rule
def publish(distribution: PythonDistributionTarget, console: Console) -> Publish:
   ...
```

This will not work because the engine has no path in the rule graph to resolve a `PythonDistribution` type given the initial input types to the rule graph (the "roots").

Instead, request `Targets`, which will give you all the targets that the user specified on the command line. The engine knows how to resolve this type because it can go from `Specs` -> `Addresses` -> `Targets`.

From here, filter out the relevant targets you want using the Target API (see [Rules and the Target API](./rules-and-the-target-api.mdx)).

```python
from pants.engine.target import Targets

@goal_rule
def publish(targets: Targets, console: Console) -> Publish:
   relevant_targets = [
       tgt for tgt in targets
       if tgt.has_field(PythonPublishDestination)
    ]
```

:::

### Only care about source files?

If you only care about files, and you don't need any metadata from BUILD files, then you can request `SpecsPaths` instead of `Targets`.

```python
from pants.engine.fs import SpecsPaths
...

@goal_rule
async def hello_world(console: Console, specs_paths: SpecsPaths) -> HelloWorld:
    for f in specs_paths.files:
        console.print_stdout(f)
    return HelloWorld(exit_code=0)
```

`SpecsPaths.files` will list all files matched by the specs, e.g. `::` will match every file in the project (regardless of if targets own the files).

To convert `SpecsPaths` into a [`Digest`](./file-system.mdx), use `await Get(Digest, PathGlobs(globs=specs_paths.files))`.

:::note Name clashing
It is very unlikely, but is still possible that adding a custom goal with an unfortunate name may cause issues when certain existing Pants options are passed in the command line. For instance, executing a goal named `local` with a particular option (in this case, the global `local_cache` option), e.g. `pants --no-local-cache local ...` would fail since there's no `--no-cache` flag defined for the `local` goal.
