Migrating away from the old call-by-type Rules API.

---

## `Get` and `MultiGet`

As [we've seen](./concepts.mdx), rules invoke other rules directly by name:

```python
from pants.engine.fs import NativeDownloadFile
from pants.engine.intrinsics import download_file
from pants.engine.rules import rule
...

@rule
async def my_rule() -> MyResult:
    downloaded_file = await download_file(
        NativeDownloadFile("https://www.google.com/robots.txt")
    )
    ...
```

However, a previous version of the Rules API had a different idiom, call-by-type. This was achieved using a construct called `Get`:

```python
from pants.engine.fs import Digest, NativeDownloadFile
from pants.engine.rules import Get, rule
...

@rule
async def my_rule() -> MyResult:
    downloaded_file = await Get(Digest, NativeDownloadFile("https://www.google.com/robots.txt"))
    ...
```

A `Get(OutputType, InputType, input)` or `Get(OutputType, InputType(...))` invoked the engine's "fill in the blanks" mechanism to find a rule or a cascade of rules that could produce a value of OutputType from the given input type (plus any contextual parameters).

To achieve concurrency you could `await MultiGet(<iterable of Gets>)`.

## `Get` and `MultiGet` are deprecated

`Get` and `MultiGet` are now deprecated, and will be removed entirely soon. Pants itself no longer uses them internally, but external plugins still might. Plugin authors must migrate from `Get`/`MultiGet` to call-by-name syntax as soon as possible.

## Migrating to call-by-name

Migrating to call-by-name is fairly straightforward:

First, replace all `MultiGet`s with `concurrently`, imported from from `pants.engine.internals.selectors`. `MultiGet` is now just an alias for `concurrently`, so this is trivial to do.

Then, replace `await Get(OutputType, InputType, input)` with `await rule_name()` where `rule_name()` is the rule that returns a value `OutputType`.

- If the rule has exactly one parameter, of type `InputType`, then this as simple as:

```python
let val = await rule_name(input)
```

- If the rule has other parameters that should be passed implicitly, then add an empty `**implicitly()`:

```python
let val = await rule_name(input, **implicitly())
```

- If the rule that returns `OutputType` does not take `InputType` directly, but rather some `IntermediateType`, then we need to tell the Pants engine to fill in the blanks, just as the `Get` would have:

```python
let val = await rule_name(**implicitly({input: InputType}))
```

There may be various corner cases that require slightly more refactoring. We encourage you to ask for help on [Slack](/community/getting-help) with those.

## Migrating union `Get`s to call-by-name

If you're relying on polymorphic dispatch via a [union](./union-rules-advanced.mdx), then you must make sure that your implementation rule has the same signature as the "base" rule (the `@rule(polymorphic=True)` rule) - the same type annotations for parameters and return value - except with your subtype in place of the union type. If things aren't working and the base rule is a standard Pants rule, you can examine its signature in the Pants source code.
