Polymorphism for the engine.

Union rules solve the same problem that polymorphism solves in general: how to write generic code that operates on types not known about at the time of writing.

For example, Pants has many generic goals like `lint` and `test`. Those `@goal_rule` definitions cannot know about every concrete linter or test implementation ahead of time.

The solution involves two related declarations:

1) A registration mechanism, `UnionRule`, that declares a specific class to be a member of a generic union.
2) A `polymorphic` keyword on the `@rule` decorator, that tells the engine that calls to the rule should be dispatched to some other rule based on the runtime type of the union member provided.

This is best understood via example:

```python title="pants/core/goals/lint.py"
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pants.engine.rules import concurrently, goal_rule, rule
from pants.engine.target import Targets
from pants.engine.unions import UnionMembership


@union
class LintTargetsRequest(ABC):
    # The union base for all specific linters.
    # Can have fields common to all linter requests here.
    ...


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class LintResults:
    ...


@rule(polymorphic=True)
async def lint_target(req: LintTargetsRequest) -> LintResults:
    # If no implementation for the member type is found, this generic
    # implementation will be invoked. In this case that is not useful,
    # so we raise.
    raise NotImplementedError(f"Must be implemented for {type(req)}")


@goal_rule
async def lint(targets: Targets, union_membership: UnionMembership) -> Lint:
    lint_request_types = union_membership[LintTargetsRequest]
    concrete_requests = [
        request_type(
            request_type.field_set_type.create(target)
            for target in targets
            if request_type.field_set_type.is_valid(target)
        )
        for request_type in lint_request_types
    ]
    results = await concurrently(
        lint_target(**implicitly({concrete_request: LintTargetsRequest}))
        for concrete_request in concrete_requests
    )
```

```python title="pants-plugins/bash/shellcheck.py"
from pants.core.goals.lint import LintResults, LintTargetsRequest
from pants.engine.rules import collect_rules, rule


# It is common for the union member to also subclass the union base.
# It's not strictly required, but it may be in the future, so it is
# good practice today.
class ShellcheckRequest(LintTargetsRequest):
    ...


@rule
async def shellcheck_target(req: ShellcheckRequest) -> LintResults:
    # At runtime, calls to the generic `lint_target()` on a
    # `ShellcheckRequest` will be dispatched here.
    ...


def rules():
    return [
        *collect_rules(),
        UnionRule(LintTargetsRequest, ShellcheckRequest),
    ]
```

This example will find all registered linter implementations by looking up `union_membership[LintTargetsRequest]`, which returns a tuple of all `LintTargetsRequest` members that were registered with a `UnionRule`, such as `ShellcheckRequest` or `Flake8Request`.

## How to create a new Union

To set up a new union, create a class for the union base. Typically, this should be an [abstract class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) that is subclassed by the union members. Mark the class with `@union`.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

from pants.engine.unions import UnionRule, union


@union
class Vehicle(ABC):
   @abstractmethod
   def num_wheels(self) -> int:
        pass
```

Then, register every implementation of your union with `UnionRule`:

```python
class Truck(Vehicle):
    def num_wheels(self) -> int:
        return 4


def rules():
    return [UnionRule(Vehicle, Truck)]
```

Now, your rules can request `UnionMembership` as a parameter in the `@rule`, and then look up `union_membership[Vehicle]` to get a tuple of all relevant types that are registered via `UnionRule`.

There are many instructive examples of Union use in the Pants codebase.

We hope to simplify this mechanism in the future to rely more heavily on Python subclassing, instead of the Pants-specific boilerplate currently required. This is why we strongly recommend making your union members subclasses of the union base.
