Common tasks for Subsystems

## Skipping individual targets

Many subsystems allow skipping specific targets. For example, you might have Python files that you want to not typecheck with mypy. In Pants, this is achieved with a `skip_*` field on the target. This is simple to implement.

1. Create a field for skipping your tool

```python
from pants.engine.target import BoolField

class SkipFortranLintField(BoolField):
	alias = "skip_fortran_lint"
	default = False
	help = "If true, don't run fortran-lint on this target's code."
```

2. Register this field on the appropriate targets.

```python
def rules():
	return [
		FortranSourceTarget.register_plugin_field(SkipFortranLintField),
	]
```

3. Add this field as part of your subsystems `opt_out` method:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pants.engine.target import FieldSet, Target


@dataclass
class FortranLintFieldSet(FieldSet):
    required_fields = (FortranSourceField,)

    source: FortranSourceField

    @classmethod
    def opt_out(cls, tgt: Target) -> bool:
        return tgt.get(SkipFortranLintField).value
```

## Making subsystems exportable with their default lockfile

:::note Support depends on language backend of the subsystem
Only some language backends support `pants export`. These include the Python and JVM backends. Only tools which are themselves written to use a backend with this feature can be exported. For example, a Python-based tool which operates on a different language is exportable.
:::

1. Make the subsystem a subclass of `ExportableTool`

    :::note Language backends may have done this in their Tool base class.
    For example, the Python backend with `PythonToolRequirementsBase` and JVM with `JvmToolBase` are already subclasses.
    :::

    ```python
    from pants.backend.python.subsystems.python_tool_base import PythonToolBase
    from pants.core.goals.resolves import ExportableTool

    class FortranLint(PythonToolBase, ExportableTool):
        ...
    ```

2. Register your class with a `UnionRule` with `ExportableTool`

    ```python
    def rules():
        return [
            UnionRule(ExportableTool, FortranLint)
        ]
    ```
