:::caution Kubernetes support is in alpha stage
Pants is currently building support for Kubernetes. Simple use cases might be
supported, but many options are missing.

Please share feedback for what you need to use Pants with your Kubernetes queries by
either [opening a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) or [joining our
Slack](/community/getting-help)!
:::

## Initial setup

First, activate the relevant backend in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
  ...
  "pants.backend.experimental.k8s",
]
```

The Kubernetes backend adds [`k8s_source`](../../reference/targets/k8s_source.mdx) and
[`k8s_sources`](../../reference/targets/k8s_sources.mdx) target types for Kubernetes object
files.

For example, create a file `src/k8s/webpages.yaml`:

```yaml title="src/k8s/webpages.yaml"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: webpages
data:
  index.html: |
    <html>
      <head>Hello pants!</head>
      <body>Hello pants!</body>
    </html>
```

Now add a `k8s_sources` target in `src/k8s/BUILD`:

```python title="src/k8s/BUILD"
k8s_sources()
```

## Deploying objects to a cluster

We'll be using a local [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster throughout the
tutorial. First, spin up a cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster
```
```
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.3) 🖼 
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦  
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜 
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ 
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
```

Second, configure the list of available contexts in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
...

[k8s]
available_contexts = [
  "kind-kind",
]
```

Third, create a deployable target `k8s_bundle` in `src/k8s/BUILD`:

```python title="src/k8s/BUILD"
k8s_sources()
k8s_bundle(
    name="webpages",
    sources=("src/k8s/webpages.yaml",),
    context="kind-kind",
)
```

Now you can deploy the target:

```bash
pants experimental-deploy src/k8s:webpages
```
```
✓ src/k8s:webpages deployed to context kind-kind
```

:::note Explicitly set kubectl contexts
To prevent accidentally deploying kubernetes manifests to the wrong cluster,
the context field is required on `k8s_bundle` for deployment. For deploying the
same `k8s_bundle` to multiple contexts, consider using [`parametrize`
builtin](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx#parametrizing-targets)
like `k8s_bundle(..., context=parametrize("stage", "prod"))`. For CI agents
which will only have access to a single context, set the
`[kubectl].pass_context` to false in `pants.toml` to have them use their
default context.
