:::caution Kubernetes support is in alpha stage
Pants is currently building support for Kubernetes. Simple use cases might be
supported, but many options are missing.

Please share feedback for what you need to use Pants with your Kubernetes queries by
either [opening a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) or [joining our
Slack](/community/getting-help)!
:::

## Initial setup

First, activate the relevant backend in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
  ...
  "pants.backend.experimental.k8s",
  ...
]
```

The Kubernetes backend adds [`k8s_source`](../../reference/targets/k8s_source.mdx) and
[`k8s_sources`](../../reference/targets/k8s_sources.mdx) target types for Kubernetes object
files. The `tailor` goal will automatically generate the targets for
your .yaml files.

For example, create a file `src/k8s/configmap.yaml`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: spark-defaults-conf
data:
  spark-defaults.conf: |
    spark.driver.memory=1g
    spark.executor.cores=1
    spark.executor.instances=1
    spark.executor.memory=2g
```

Now run:

```bash
pants tailor src/k8s:
```
```
Created src/k8s/BUILD:
  - Add k8s_sources target k8s
```
