# How to Convert a Polyrepo to a Monorepo with Pants

## Introduction

In software development, teams often organize their codebases in one of two ways: a **polyrepo** or a **monorepo**. A polyrepo strategy involves splitting the codebase across many different version control repositories, with each project or library living on its own. In contrast, a monorepo is a single, unified repository that holds the code for all projects.

Many growing organizations find themselves migrating from a polyrepo to a monorepo to simplify dependencies and improve collaboration. This guide explains the benefits of this migration and how the Pants build system is specifically designed to make managing a monorepo not just possible, but efficient and scalable.

## The Benefits of Migrating

Moving to a monorepo can seem daunting, but it offers several powerful advantages, especially when managed with a tool like Pants:

* **Unified Versioning:** Say goodbye to complex dependency matrices. In a monorepo, all code lives at the same commit, so you never have to wonder which version of a library works with which version of an application.

* **Atomic Commits:** Changes that affect multiple projects (like updating a shared library and all the applications that use it) can be made in a single, atomic commit. This ensures that your entire codebase is always in a consistent state.

* **Simplified Dependencies:** Instead of publishing and consuming versioned artifacts for your internal libraries, projects can depend directly on each other's source code. This removes a significant amount of overhead and complexity.

* **Seamless Refactoring:** You can refactor code across multiple projects with confidence. Your IDE and build tools can see the entire codebase, making it easy to find all usages of a function and update them at once.

## How Pants Makes it Possible

Pants is designed from the ground up to handle the challenges of a large, multi-language monorepo. It provides several key features that make a polyrepo-to-monorepo migration successful:

* **Fine-Grained Dependency Inference:** Pants can automatically detect the dependencies for your code by analyzing your `import` statements. This means you don't have to manually declare every single dependency in configuration files, which is a massive time-saver in a large repository.

* **Advanced Caching:** Pants intelligently caches the results of every task it runs. If your code hasn't changed, Pants will reuse the cached result instead of re-running the task. This makes builds, tests, and checks incredibly fast, as you only ever work on what has actually changed.

* **Scalable Concurrency:** Pants is highly parallelized and can take full advantage of all the cores on your machine. This ensures that your repository remains fast and responsive, even as it grows with more code and more developers.

* **Powerful Target Addressing:** Pants allows you to run commands on any subset of your codebase. You can run tests for the whole monorepo, a single project, a single file, or—most powerfully—only on the files that have changed.

## Conceptual Steps for Migration

While every migration is unique, here is a high-level conceptual walkthrough of how you might use Pants to convert from a polyrepo to a monorepo:

1.  **Set Up the Monorepo:** Start by creating a new, single repository. Initialize it with a Pants configuration file (`pants.toml`) to define basic settings for your new monorepo.

2.  **Import Your First Project:** Copy the source code of one of your existing projects from its old repository into a subdirectory in the new monorepo.

3.  **Add `BUILD` Files:** Create `BUILD` files for the code you just imported. A `BUILD` file tells Pants what kind of code is in a directory (e.g., a Python library or a test suite). Thanks to dependency inference, these files are often very minimal.

4.  **Test and Verify:** Run Pants commands like `pants lint`, `pants check`, and `pants test` on your imported code to ensure that Pants understands it and that it works correctly in its new home.

5.  **Repeat and Integrate:** Once your first project is working, you can repeat the process. Import your other projects one by one, adding `BUILD` files and testing as you go. Because all the code is in one place, you can immediately have the newly imported code depend on the projects you've already integrated.

## Conclusion

Migrating from a polyrepo to a monorepo is a significant undertaking, but it can unlock major improvements in developer productivity and codebase consistency. Build systems like Pants are essential tools for this journey, providing the speed, scalability, and powerful features needed to manage a monorepo effectively without sacrificing performance.
