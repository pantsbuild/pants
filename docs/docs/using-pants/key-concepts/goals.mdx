The commands Pants runs.

---

Pants commands are known as _goals_, such as `test` and `lint`.

To see the current list of goals, run:

```bash
❯ pants help goals
```

You'll see more goals activated as you activate more [backends](./backends.mdx).

## Running goals

For example:

```
❯ pants count-loc project/app_test.py
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Language                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Python                       1       374       16        19      339          6
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                        1       374       16        19      339          6
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

You can also run multiple goals in a single run of Pants, in which case they will run sequentially:

```bash
# Format all code, and then test it:
❯ pants fmt test ::
```

Finally, Pants supports running goals in a `--loop`. In this mode, all goals specified will run sequentially, and then Pants will wait until a relevant file has changed to try running them again.

```bash
# Re-run linters and testing continuously as files or their dependencies change:
❯ pants --loop lint test project/app_test.py
```

Use `Ctrl+C` to exit the `--loop`.

## Goal arguments

Most goals require arguments to know what to work on.

You can use several argument types:

| Argument type                                     | Semantics                                   | Example                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| File path                                         | Match the file                              | `pants test project/tests.py` |
| Directory path                                    | Match everything in the directory           | `pants test project/utils`    |
| `::` globs                                        | Match everything in the directory and below | `pants test project::`        |
| [Target addresses](./targets-and-build-files.mdx) | Match the target                            | `pants package project:tests` |

You can combine argument types, e.g. `pants fmt src/go:: src/py/app.py`.

You can address targets from the root of the repository by using plain `::` and `:`. For example, `pants package ::` would produce artifacts for all packages declared in the whole repository and `pants package :` would produce artifacts only for those packages that are declared in the root directory of the repository.

To ignore something, prefix the argument with `-`. For example, `pants test :: -project/integration_tests` will run all your tests except for those in the directory `project/integration_tests` and `pants package project:: -project:` will package all targets in the subdirectories of the `project` directory, recursively, except for those declared directly under the `project` directory.

:::note Tip: advanced target selection, such as running over changed files
See [Advanced target selection](../advanced-target-selection.mdx) for alternative techniques to specify which files/targets to run on.

### Goal options

Many goals also have [options](./options.mdx) to change how they behave. Every option in Pants can be set via an environment variable, config file, and the command line.

To see if a goal has any options, run `pants help $goal` or `pants help-advanced $goal`. See [Command Line Help](/community/getting-help) for more information.

For example:

```
❯ pants help test
17:20:14.24 [INFO] Remote cache/execution options updated: reinitializing scheduler...
17:20:15.36 [INFO] Scheduler initialized.

`test` goal options
-------------------

Run tests.

Config section: [test]

  --[no-]test-debug
  PANTS_TEST_DEBUG
  debug
      default: False
      current value: False
      Run tests sequentially in an interactive process. This is necessary, for example, when you
      add breakpoints to your code.

...
```

You can then use the option by prefixing it with the goal name:

```bash
pants --test-debug test project/app_test.py
```

You can also put the option after the file/target arguments:

```bash
pants test project/app_test.py --test-debug
```

As a shorthand, if you put the option after the goal and before the file/target arguments, you can leave off the goal name in the flag:

```bash
pants test --debug project/app_test.py
```
