Self-extractable archives with [`makeself`](https://github.com/megastep/makeself)

---

Pants integrates with [`makeself`](https://github.com/megastep/makeself) tool
to allow you to easily build self-extractable archives. To enable the
integration activate the `makeself` backend in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
    ...
    "pants.backend.experimental.makeself",
]
```

## Minimal example

The [`makeself_archive`](../../reference/targets/makeself_archive.mdx) target
allows you to bundle files and packages into a single executable archive.

Here is a minimal example:

```python title="BUILD"
makeself_archive(
    name="arc",
    startup_script=["echo", "hello pants"],
)
```

To build the archive use the `package` goal:

```bash
pants package :arc
```
```
[INFO] Wrote dist/arc.run
Built Makeself binary: arc.run
```

Now run the archive just like a regular executable:

```bash
dist/arc.run
```
```
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
hello pants
```

The built archive supports a bunch of parameters, you can inspect them manually:

```bash
dist/arc.run --help
```

Or refer to the [`makeself`](https://github.com/megastep/makeself) documentation.

## Bundling multiple files

You can bundle multiple shell scripts using
[`files`](../../reference/targets/makeself_archive.mdx#files) field:

```python tab={"label":"BUILD"}
shell_sources(name="src")

makeself_archive(
    name="arc",
    files=["lib.sh:src", "entrypoint.sh:src"],
    startup_script=["./entrypoint.sh"],
)
```

```bash tab={"label":"entrypoint.sh"} 
#!/bin/bash

. lib.sh
echo $@ "one two three" | first_column
```

```bash tab={"label":"lib.sh"} 
#!/bin/bash

function first_column {
    awk '{print $1}'
}
```

Notice that we need to use a relative path to the `./entrypoint.sh`.

```bash
pants package :arc && dist/arc.run
```
```
[INFO] Wrote dist/arc.run
Built Makeself binary: arc.run
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
one
```

To pass the arguments to the `startup_script` use `--`:

```bash
pants package :arc && dist/arc.run -- zero
```
```
[INFO] Wrote dist/arc.run
Built Makeself binary: arc.run
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
zero
```

## `pants run`

Instead of packaging and running `makeself_archive` manually, you can use the `run` goal instead:

```bash
pants run :arc
```
```
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
one
```

To pass the arguments through the `pants run` goal you need `--`, then you need
another `--` to pass arguments to the archive's `startup_script`, so you end up with
two `--`:

```bash
pants run :arc -- -- zero
```
```
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
zero
```

Similarly you can pass flags to the archive, for example, `quiet` flag to suppress progress messages:
```bash
pants run :arc -- -q -- zero
```
```
zero
```

## Bundling packages like `pex_binary`

You can put other packages like `pex_binary` into a makeself archive. 

To configure `pex_binary`, first, update your `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
backend_packages = [
    ...
    "pants.backend.shell",
    "pants.backend.experimental.makeself",
    "pants.backend.python",
]

[python]
interpreter_constraints = ["CPython==3.12.*"]
```

Now define the `pex_binary` and add it to the makeself archive via the
`packages` field:

```python tab={"label":"BUILD"}
python_sources(name="py")
pex_binary(
    name="upper",
    entry_point="upper.py",
)
shell_sources(name="sh")
makeself_archive(
    name="arc",
    files=["lib.sh:sh", "entrypoint.sh:sh"],
    packages=[":upper"],
    startup_script=["./entrypoint.sh"],
)
```

```python tab={"label":"upper.py"}
print(input().upper())
```

```bash tab={"label":"entrypoint.sh"} 
#!/bin/bash

. lib.sh
echo $@ "one two three" | first_column | ./upper.pex
```

```bash tab={"label":"lib.sh"} 
#!/bin/bash

function first_column {
    awk '{print $1}'
}
```

```bash
pants run :arc -- -q -- zero
```
```
/usr/bin/env: ‘python3.12’: No such file or directory
```

Oops! This happened because `pants run` is running in isolated environment, so
we have to explicitly tell pants that we want to access the python interpreter
and a couple of binaries used by pex:

```python title="BUILD"
...
makeself_archive(
    name="arc",
    files=["lib.sh:sh", "entrypoint.sh:sh"],
    packages=[":upper"],
    startup_script=["./entrypoint.sh"],
    tools=["python3.12", "grep", "sort"],
)
```

Now it should work:

```bash
pants run :arc -- -q -- zero
```
```
ZERO
```

Yay!

## Using `makeself` build args

To control the `makeself` archive creation you can provide `args` field:

```python title="BUILD"
makeself_archive(
    name="arc",
    startup_script=["echo", "Done"],
    args=["--xz", "--nomd5"],
    tools=["xz"],
) 
```
```bash
pants run :arc
```
```
Verifying archive integrity...  100%   CRC checksums are OK. All good.
Uncompressing arc.run  100%  
Done
```
