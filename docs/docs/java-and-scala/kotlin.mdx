Kotlin support for Pants.

---

:::caution Kotlin support is alpha stage
Kotlin support in Pants is still under active development, but currently supports compilation and testing. It has been tested with Kotlin v1.6.20.

Please share feedback for what you need to use Pants with your Kotlin project by either [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) or [joining our Slack](/community/members)!

## Overview

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a programming language from Jetbrains that runs on the JVM and certain other platforms. The Kotlin backend in Pants supports compilation, testing, and linting of [Kotlin code for the JVM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html). (The other Kotlin platforms including [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html) are not currently supported, nor are there currently any plans to do so.)

## Initial Setup

First, activate the Kotlin backend in `pants.toml` plus the `ktlint` backend if you would like to use [`ktlint`](https://ktlint.github.io/) for code formatting and linting:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
  "pants.backend.experimental.kotlin",

  # Activate the following backend if you want to use `ktlint` for code formatting and linting.
  "pants.backend.experimental.kotlin.lint.ktlint",
]
```

### Setting up targets

Run [`pants tailor ::`](../getting-started/initial-configuration.mdx#5-generate-build-files) to generate BUILD files. This will create `kotlin_sources` targets in every directory containing library code, as well as `kotlin_junit_tests` targets for filenames that look like tests.

```
❯ pants tailor ::
Created src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app/BUILD:
  - Add kotlin_sources target app
Created src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/json/BUILD:
  - Add kotlin_sources target json
Created src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/BUILD:
  - Add java_sources target lib
```

You can run `pants list ::` to see all targets in your project:

```
❯ pants list ::
...
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app:app
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app/ExampleApp.kt
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/json:json
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/json/JsonExample.kt
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib:lib
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLib.java
```

### Choosing JDK and Kotlin versions

Pants supports choosing the JDK and Kotlin versions per target in your repository. To reduce the amount of boilerplate required, however, most users set repository-wide defaults in `pants.toml`, and then only override them when necessary for particular targets.

#### JDK

JDKs used by Pants are automatically fetched using [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/), and are chosen using the [`[jvm].jdk` option](../../reference/subsystems/jvm.mdx#section-jdk) to set a repository-wide default.

To override the default on a particular target, you can use the [`jdk=` field](../../reference/targets/kotlin_source.mdx#codejdkcode). It can be useful to use the [`parametrize` builtin](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx#parametrizing-targets) with the `jdk=` field, particularly to run test targets under multiple JDKs.

#### Kotlin version

The Kotlin version to use is configured on a resolve-by-resolve basis (see the "Third-party dependencies" section below) using the [`[kotlin].version_for_resolve` option](../../reference/subsystems/kotlin.mdx#section-version_for_resolve). The default Kotlin version for your repository will thus be whichever Kotlin version is configured for the "default" resolve, which is configured by the [`[jvm].default_resolve` option](reference-jvm#section-default-resolve).

Each resolve must contain the following jars for the Kotlin runtime with the version matching the version specified for the resolve in the `[kotlin].version_for_resolve` option:

- `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib`
- `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect`
- `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-script-runtime`

To use multiple Kotlin versions in a repository, you would define multiple resolves, and then adjust the [`resolve` field](../../reference/targets/kotlin_junit_test.mdx#coderesolvecode) of any targets which should be used with the non-`default_resolve` resolve.

To cross-build a set of Kotlin targets for multiple Kotlin versions, you can use the [`parametrize` builtin](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx#parametrizing-targets) with the `resolve=` field of the target and its dependencies.

:::caution `jvm_artifact` targets for the Kotlin runtime must be explicitly defined.
The Kotlin backend currently requires that a `jvm_artifact` target for each Kotlin runtime jars be present in any resolve used for Kotlin. If any of the required `jvm_artifact` targets are missing, Pants will error. Pants will automatically inject a dependency on the runtime into Kotlin targets. (These targets may be automatically supplied by Pants in a future version, but that is not currently implemented.)
:::

### Dependencies

#### First-party dependencies

In many cases, the dependencies of your first-party code are automatically inferred via [dependency inference](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/automatically-unlocking-concurrent-builds-and-fine-grained-caching-on-the-jvm-with-dependency-inference/) based on `import` statements in the code. If you do need to declare additional dependencies for any reason, you can do so using Pants' [syntax for declaring dependencies for targets](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx).

#### Third-party dependencies and lockfiles

Third-party dependencies (i.e. those from repositories like [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/)) are also automatically inferred via dependency inference, but must first be declared once per repository as [`jvm_artifact` targets](../../reference/targets/jvm_artifact.mdx):

```python title="BUILD"
jvm_artifact(
    group="com.google.guava",
    artifact="guava",
    version="31.0.1-jre",
    # See the callout below for more information on the `packages` argument.
    packages=["com.google.common.**"],
)
```

Pants requires use of a lockfile for third-party dependencies. After adding or editing `jvm_artifact` targets, you will need to update affected lockfiles by running `pants generate-lockfiles`. The default lockfile is located at `3rdparty/jvm/default.lock`, but it can be relocated (as well as additional resolves declared) via the [`[jvm].resolves` option](../../reference/subsystems/jvm.mdx#section-resolves).

:::note Thirdparty symbols and the `packages` argument
To efficiently determine which symbols are provided by third-party code (i.e., without hitting the network in order to compute dependencies in the common case), Pants relies on a static mapping of which artifacts provide which symbols, and defaults to treating each `jvm_artifact` as providing symbols within its `group`.

The `packages` argument allows you to override which symbols a `jvm_artifact` provides. See the [`jvm_artifact` docs](../../reference/targets/jvm_artifact.mdx#codepackagescode) for more information.
:::

#### `resource` targets

To have your code [load files as "resources"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/lang/resources.html):

1. Add a `resource` or `resources` target with the relevant files in the `source` / `sources` field, respectively.
2. Ensure that [an appropriate `source_root`](../using-pants/key-concepts/source-roots.mdx) is detected for the `resources` target, in order to trim the relevant prefix from the filename to align with the layout of your JVM packages.
3. Add that target to the `dependencies` field of the relevant JVM target (usually the one that uses the JVM APIs to load the resource).

For example:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[source]
# In order for the resource to be loadable as `org/pantsbuild/example/lib/hello.txt`,
# the `/src/jvm/ prefix needs to be stripped.
root_patterns = ["/src/*"]
```

```python title="src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/BUILD"
kotlin_sources(dependencies=[":hello"])

resources(name="hello", sources=["hello.txt"])
```

```java title="src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/Loader.java"
package org.pantsbuild.example.lib

import com.google.common.io.Resources

fun load() {
  ... = Resources.getResource(Loader.class, "hello.txt")
}
```

```text title="src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/hello.txt"
Hello world!
```

## Tasks

### Compile code

To manually check that sources compile, use `pants check`:

```
# Check a single file
❯ pants check src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLib.kt

# Check files located recursively under a directory
❯ pants check src/jvm::

# Check the whole repository
❯ pants check ::
```

### Run tests

To run tests, use `pants test`:

```
# Run a single test file
❯ pants test tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLibTest.kt

# Test all files in and under a directory
❯ pants test tests/jvm::

# Test the whole repository
❯ pants test ::
```

The Kotlin backend currently supports JUnit tests specified using the `kotlin_junit_tests` target type.

#### Setting environment variables

Test runs are _hermetic_, meaning that they are stripped of the parent `pants` process's environment variables. This is important for reproducibility, and it also increases cache hits.

To add any arbitrary environment variable back to the process, you can either add the environment variable to the specific tests with the `extra_env_vars` field on `kotlin_junit_test` / `kotlin_junit_tests` targets or to all your tests with the `[test].extra_env_vars` option. Generally, prefer the field `extra_env_vars` field so that more of your tests are hermetic.

With both `[test].extra_env_vars` and the `extra_env_vars` field, you can either hardcode a value or leave off a value to "allowlist" it and read from the parent `pants` process's environment.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[test]
extra_env_vars = ["VAR1", "VAR2=hardcoded_value"]
```

```python title="project/BUILD"
kotlin_junit_tests(
    name="tests",
    # Adds to all generated `kotlin_junit_test` targets,
    # i.e. each file in the `sources` field.
    extra_env_vars=["VAR3", "VAR4=hardcoded"],
    # Even better, use `overrides` to be more granular.
    overrides={
        "StrUtilTest.kt": {"extra_env_vars": ["VAR"]},
        ("DirUtilTest.kt", "OSUtilTest.kt"): {"extra_env_vars": ["VAR5"]},
    },
)
```

### Lint and Format

[`ktlint`](https://ktlint.github.io/) can be enabled by adding the `pants.backend.experimental.kotlin.lint.ktlint` backend to `backend_packages` in the `[GLOBAL]` section of `pants.toml`.

Once enabled, `lint` and `fmt` will check and automatically reformat your code:

```
# Format this directory and all subdirectories
❯ pants fmt src/jvm::

# Check that the whole project is formatted
❯ pants lint ::

# Format all changed files
❯ pants --changed-since=HEAD fmt
```

## Caveats

The Kotlin backend is currently experimental since many features are not implemented including:

- Kotlin modules. We would love to hear from Kotlin developers for advice on how modules are used and could be potentially supported by Pants.
- Non-JVM backends including [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html)
