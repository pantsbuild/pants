:::caution Terraform support is in alpha stage
Pants is currently building support for developing and deploying Terraform. Simple use cases might be supported, but many options are missing.

Please share feedback for what you need to use Pants with your Terraform modules and deployments by either [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) or [joining our Slack](/community/getting-help)!
:::

## Initial setup

First, activate the relevant backend in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
  ...
  "pants.backend.experimental.terraform",
  ...
]
```

The Terraform backend also needs Python to run Pants's analysers. The setting `[python].interpreter_constraints` will need to be set.

### Adding Terraform targets

The Terraform backend has 2 target types:

- `terraform_module` for Terraform source code
- `terraform_deployment` for deployments that can be deployed with the `experimental-deploy` goal

#### Modules

The `tailor` goal will automatically generate `terraform_module` targets. Run [`pants tailor ::`](../getting-started/initial-configuration.mdx#5-generate-build-files). For example:

```
❯ pants tailor ::
Created src/terraform/root/BUILD:
  - Add terraform_module target root
```

#### Deployments

`terraform_deployments` must be manually created. The deployment points to a `terraform_module` target as its `root_module` field. This module will be the "root" module that Terraform operations will be run on. You can reference vars files with the `var_files` field. You can have multiple deployments reference the same module:

```
terraform_module(name="root")
terraform_deployment(name="prod", root_module=":root", var_files=["prod.tfvars"])
terraform_deployment(name="test", root_module=":root", var_files=["test.tfvars"])
```

#### Lockfiles

Automatic lockfile management is currently in progress. You can include lockfiles manually as a dependency:

```
terraform_deployment(name="prod", root_module=":root", dependencies=[":lockfile"])
file(name="lockfile", source=".terraform.lock.hcl")
```

### Basic Operations

#### Formatting

Run `terraform fmt` as part of the `fix`, `fmt`, or `lint` goals.

```
pants fix ::
[INFO] Completed: pants.backend.terraform.lint.tffmt.tffmt.tffmt_fmt - terraform-fmt made no changes.

✓ terraform-fmt made no changes.
```

#### Validate

Run `terraform validate` as part of the `check` goal.

```
pants check ::
[INFO] Completed: pants.backend.terraform.goals.check.terraform_check - terraform-validate succeeded.
Success! The configuration is valid.

✓ terraform-validate succeeded.

```

`terraform validate` isn't valid for all Terraform modules. Some child modules, in particular those using aliased providers, need to have their providers provided by a "root" module. You can opt these modules out of `validate` by setting `skip_terraform_validate=True`. For example:

```
terraform_module(skip_terraform_validate=True)
```

#### Deploying

:::caution Terraform deployment support is in alpha stage
Many options and features aren't supported yet.
Local state backends aren't supported.
:::

Run `terraform apply` as part of the `experimental-deploy` goal. The process is run interactively, so you will be prompted for variables and confirmation as usual.

```
pants experimental-deploy ::
[INFO] Deploying targets...
--- 8< ---
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
--- 8< ---
Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

✓ testprojects/src/terraform/root:root deployed
```

You can set auto approve by adding `-auto-approve` to the `[download-terraform].args` setting in `pants.toml`. You can also set it for a single pants invocation with `--download-terraform-args='-auto-approve'`, for example `pants experimental-deploy "--download-terraform-args='-auto-approve'"`.
