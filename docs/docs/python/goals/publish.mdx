How to distribute packages to a PyPi repository

---

The `publish` goal is currently in the experimental Python backend. Activate it with this config:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages.add = [
  "pants.backend.experimental.python",
]
```

This will register a new `repositories` field on the `python_distribution` target type, so that when you run `pants publish` on such targets they will be packaged into wheels and/or sdists, and then published to the repositories specified in your BUILD files.

## Python Repositories

When publishing a `python_distribution`, you need to tell Pants which repositories to publish to. That is done with a new `repositories` field on `python_distribution` targets.

```python tab={"label":"src/python/BUILD"}
python_distribution(
  name="demo",
  # ...
  repositories=[
    "@pypi",
    "@private-repo",
    "https://pypi.private2.example.com",
  ]
)
```

```text tab={"label":".pypirc"}
[distutils]
index-servers =
	pypi
  private-repo

[pypi]
username: publisher-example

[private-repo]
repository: https://pypi.private.example.com
```

Each repository is either a repository URL or, when prefixed with `@`, a reference to a repository configured in the `.pypirc` file.

:::danger Keep Secrets Secret
We strongly discourage the use of secrets verbatim in your configuration files.

It is better to provide the required secrets using environment variables when running `pants publish`. Or, better yet, to use `keyring` as described in the [Twine documentation](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#keyring-support)
:::

## Environment variables

Pants will pass certain configuration [environment variables](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#environment-variables), through to Twine. If multiple repositories are involved in a single `publish` goal, you can distinguish them by adding an underscore and the repository name (upper-cased, and with hyphens replaced with underscores) as a suffix on the environment variable names:

- `TWINE_USERNAME`
- `TWINE_USERNAME_<repository>`
- `TWINE_PASSWORD`
- `TWINE_PASSWORD_<repository>`
- `TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL`
- `TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL_<repository>`

```shell title="secrets"
# Ephemeral file
export TWINE_USERNAME_PRIVATE_REPO="accountname"
export TWINE_PASSWORD_PRIVATE_REPO="secretvalue"
```

Given the example `BUILD` and `.pypirc` files from the previous section, `demo` could be published with the following command:

```shell
$ { source ./secrets && pants publish src/python:demo }
```
