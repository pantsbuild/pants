How to enable Pants's bundled Python backend package.

---

:::note Example Python repository
See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-python) for examples of Pants's Python functionality.

See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-django) for Django-specific examples.

Enable the Python [backend](../../using-pants/key-concepts/backends.mdx) like this:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
  "pants.backend.python"
]
```

Pants use [`python_source`](../../../reference/targets/python_source.mdx) and [`python_test`](../../../reference/targets/python_test.mdx) targets to know which Python files to run on and to set any metadata.

To reduce boilerplate, the [`python_sources`](../../../reference/targets/python_sources.mdx) target generates a `python_source` target for each file in its `sources` field, and [`python_tests`](../../../reference/targets/python_tests.mdx) generates a `python_test` target for each file in its `sources` field.

```python title="BUILD"
python_sources(name="lib", sources=["dirutil.py", "strutil.py"])
python_tests(name="tests", sources=["strutil_test.py"])

# Spiritually equivalent to:
python_source(name="dirutil", source="dirutil.py")
python_source(name="strutil", source="strutil.py")
python_test(name="strutil_test.py", source="strutil_test.py")

# Thanks to the default `sources` values, spiritually equivalent to:
python_sources(name="lib")
python_tests(name="tests")
```

You can generate these targets by running [`pants tailor ::`](../../getting-started/initial-configuration.mdx#5-generate-build-files).

```
❯ pants tailor ::
Created project/BUILD:
  - Add python_sources target project
  - Add python_tests target tests
```

:::caution macOS users: you may need to change interpreter search paths
By default, Pants will look at both your `$PATH` and—if you use Pyenv—your `$(pyenv root)/versions` folder when discovering Python interpreters. Your `$PATH` likely includes the system Pythons at `/usr/bin/python` and `/usr/bin/python3`, which are known to have many issues like failing to install some dependencies.

Pants will prefer new Python versions, like 3.6.10 over 3.6.3. Because macOS system Pythons are usually very old, they will usually be ignored.

However, if you run into issues, you can set the `search_paths` option in the `[python-bootstrap]` scope:

```toml
[python-bootstrap]
search_path = [
    # This will use all interpreters in `$(pyenv root)/versions`.
    "<PYENV>",
     # Brew usually installs Python here.
    "/usr/local/bin",
]
```

See [here](./interpreter-compatibility.mdx#changing-the-interpreter-search-path) for more information.
