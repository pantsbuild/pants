How we recommend staying up-to-date with Pants.

:::note Reminder: change the `pants_version` to upgrade
Change the `pants_version` option in the `[GLOBAL]` scope in your pants.toml to upgrade.

You can see all releases at [https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases).

## Upgrade one minor release at a time

Per our [Deprecation policy](./deprecation-policy.mdx), deprecations must last a minimum of one minor release. For example, something may be deprecated in 2.1.0 and then removed in 2.2.0.

This means that it is helpful to upgrade one minor release at a time so that you can see all deprecation warnings.

You do not need to land every upgrade into your organization—often, you will want to upgrade your organization multiple versions at a time, e.g. 2.1.0 to 2.4.0. But, when you are working on the upgrade locally, it is helpful to iterate one version at a time.

First, see if Pants can automatically fix any safe deprecations for you:

```bash
# To avoid unrelated formatting changes, you may want to use `--no-fmt`.
❯ pants update-build-files --no-fmt ::
```

You can add `update-build-files` to your [continuous integration](../using-pants/using-pants-in-ci.mdx) so that developers don't accidentally use removed features:

```bash
❯ pants update-build-files --check ::
```

Then, see if there are any remaining deprecation warnings:

```bash
❯ pants
❯ pants list :: > /dev/null
❯ pants filedeps :: > /dev/null
```

It is also helpful to spot-check that your main commands like `lint`, `package`, and `test` still work by running on a single target.

:::note Use dev releases for the newest
As described in our [Release strategy](../contributions/releases/release-strategy.mdx), we make weekly dev releases with all the latest features and bug fixes we've been working on. While dev releases are less stable, they mean you get access to improvements sooner.

If you encounter any blocking issues, you can easily roll back to a prior version by changing the `pants_version` option. (Please let us know the issue by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues) or messaging us on [Slack](/community/members)).

## Ignore deprecation messages with `ignore_warnings`

Sometimes when upgrading, you will not have time to fully fix the deprecation. The `ignore_warnings` option allows you to silence those deprecations.

The `ignore_warnings` option expects a string with the start of the deprecation warning. You can also prefix the string with `$regex$` to use a regex pattern instead of literal string matching.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
ignore_warnings = [
  "DEPRECATED: option 'config' in scope 'flake8' will be removed",
  "$regex$DEPRECATED:\\s*",
]
```

## Check for updates to the `pants` script

Run `curl -L -o pants https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup/pants` to check if there have been any changes, e.g. adding support for running Pants with new Python interpreters.

:::caution Consider migrating to the new `pants` binary
The `pants` script is deprecated. The new `pants` binary has many improvements over the script, including an embedded Python runtime. The [installation page](../getting-started/installing-pants.mdx) has more details on how to migrate.
