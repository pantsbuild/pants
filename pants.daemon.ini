# A config override that enables use of pantsd. This is currently recommended for beta testers.
#
# Usage:
#
#    In a shell that you want to use the daemon in:
#
#      $ export PANTS_CONFIG_FILES="$(pwd)/pants.daemon.ini"
#
#    And then use pants as you normally would:
#
#      $ ./pants ...
#
#    To kill the daemon, you can run either `clean-all` or `kill-pantsd`:
#
#      $ ./pants clean-all
#      $ ./pants kill-pantsd
#
#
# Observation Tools:
#
#  To see what's going on with the daemon, you can tail the pantsd log file in another window:
#
#    $ cd $SOURCE
#    $ tail -F .pants.d/pantsd/pantsd.log
#
#  To see what's going on with the client, runner and daemon processes you can watch the process table:
#
#    $ watch -n.1 "ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep pants"
#
