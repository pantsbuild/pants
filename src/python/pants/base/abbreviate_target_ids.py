def abbreviate_target_ids(targets):
  """Map a list of target IDs to shortened versions.

  This method takes a list of strings (e.g. target IDs) and maps them to shortened versions of
  themselves.

  The original strings should consist of '.'-delimited segments, and the abbreviated versions are
  subsequences of these segments such that each string's subsequence is unique from others in @targets.

  For example: ::

     input: [
       'com.pants.a.b',
       'com.pants.a.c',
       'com.pants.d'
     ]

  might return: ::

     {
       'com.pants.a.b': 'b',
       'com.pants.a.c': 'c',
       'com.pants.d': 'd'
     }

  This can be useful for debugging purposes, removing a lot of boilerplate from printed lists of
  target IDs.

  :param targets: List of strings representing target IDs.
