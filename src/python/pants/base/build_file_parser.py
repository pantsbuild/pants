# Note: Significant effort has been made to keep the types BuildFile, BuildGraph, Address, and
# Target separated appropriately.  The BulidFileParser is intended to have knowledge of just
# BuildFile and Address.
#
# Here are some guidelines to help maintain this abstraction:
#  - Use the terminology 'address' instead of 'target' in symbols and user messages
#  - Wrap exceptions from BuildFile with a subclass of BuildFileParserError
#     so that callers do not have to reference the BuildFile module
#
# Note: In general, 'spec' should not be a user visible term, it is usually appropriate to
# substitute 'address' instead.
