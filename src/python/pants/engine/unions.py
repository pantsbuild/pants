    """A class decorator to allow a class to be a union base in the engine's mechanism for
    polymorphism.

    Annotating a class with @union allows other classes to register a `UnionRule(BaseClass,
    MemberClass)`. Then, you can use `Get(Output, BaseClass, member_class_instance)`. This
    would be similar to writing `Get(Output, MemberClass, member_class_instance)`, but allows you
    to write generic code without knowing what concrete classes might later implement that union.

    Often, union bases are abstract classes, but they need not be.

    By default, in order to provide a stable extension API, when a `@union` is used in a `Get`,
    _only_ the provided parameter is available to callees, But in order to expand its API, a
    `@union` declaration may optionally include additional "in_scope_types", which are types
    which must already be in scope at callsites where the `@union` is used in a `Get`, and
    which are propagated to the callee.

    See https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/writing-plugins/the-rules-api/union-rules-advanced.
