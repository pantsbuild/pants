    """A class decorator to allow a class to be a union base in the engine's mechanism for
    polymorphism.

    Annotating a class with @union allows other classes to register a `UnionRule(BaseClass,
    MemberClass)`. Then, you can use `await Get(Output, UnionBase, concrete_union_member)`. This
    would be similar to writing `UnionRule(Output, ConcreteUnionMember,
    concrete_union_member_instance)`, but allows you to write generic code without knowing what
    concrete classes might later implement that union.

    Often, union bases are abstract classes, but they need not be.
