  In order to attempt to execute a set of requested phases against a portion of the target graph
  the engine 1st linearizes the phase graph such that tasks that depend on a phase are ordered
  after all tasks in that phase.  The linearization further maintains strict in-phase ordering of
  tasks as-installed in their phases.

  With this linearized task list the engine 1st prepares all the tasks in reverse order such that
  a task depending on products from an earlier phase can request these.

  Finally the engine executes the prepared tasks in the order established in the linearized task
