class AddressableDescriptor:
    """A data descriptor for fields containing one or more addressable items.

    An addressable descriptor has lifecycle expectations tightly coupled with the contract of
    Serializable objects and the 2-phase hydration of AddressMap.parse, Graph.resolve.

    Decorated accessors are write-once, and then read-only.  They are intended to be written in a
    constructor such that objects containing them have immutable semantics. In other words, the
    descriptor is intended to be used like a type-checked `@property` with possibly lazily resolved
    values.

    The written value is type-checked against a :class:`TypeConstraint` and can only be one of 3
    types:

    1. An opaque string address.
    2. A Resolvable for the address that, when resolved, will meet the type constraint.
    3. A concrete value that meets the type constraint.

    The 1st type, an opaque string address, is also the type associated with the 1st stage of the
    2-stage lifecycle of Serializable objects containing addressable values.  In the second and final
    stage, the Serializable object is re-constructed with addressable values of the second or third
    types; ie: reconstructed with either resolvables or concrete values in place of the first stage
    address.

    Two affordances are made in type constraint handling:

    1. Either a :class:`TypeConstraint` instance can be given if the type constraint is fully known or
       else a type constraint class can be given if the type constraint should apply to the type of
       the enclosing class.  This is useful for declaring an addressable property in a baseclass that
       should be type-constrained based on the type of the derived class.
    2. Decorators for addressables (see `addressable`, `addressable_sequence` and `addressable_dict`)
       allow wrapping of either class functions - typical - or @property descriptors.  The property
       descriptor case sets up an idiom for recursive addressables.  The idiom looks like:

       >>> class Thing(Struct):
       ...   def __init__(self, thing):
       ...     super().__init__()
       ...     self.thing = thing
       ...   @property
       ...   def parent(self):
       ...     '''Return this thing's parent.
       ...
       ...     :rtype: :class:`Thing`
       ...     '''
       ...
       >>> Thing.parent = addressable(Exactly(Thing))(Thing.parent)

    Here the `Thing.parent` property is re-assigned with a type-constrained addressable descriptor
    after the class is defined so the class can be referred to in the type constraint.
