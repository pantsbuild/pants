"""Synthetic targets is a concept of injecting targets into the build graph that doesn't have a home
in any BUILD file.

This is achieved by declaring a union member for the `SyntheticTargetsRequest` union along
with a rule taking that member and returning a collection of `SyntheticAddressMap`s.

Example demonstrating how to register synthetic targets:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from pants.engine.internals.synthetic_targets import (
        SyntheticAddressMaps,
        SyntheticTargetsRequest,

        path: str = SyntheticTargetsRequest.SINGLE_REQUEST_FOR_ALL_TARGETS


    class SyntheticExampleTargetsPerDirectorySpecPathsRequest:
        pass


    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class SyntheticExampleTargetsPerDirectoryRequest(SyntheticTargetsRequest):
        path: str = SyntheticTargetsRequest.REQUEST_TARGETS_PER_DIRECTORY

        # Optional: (without it, only paths with BUILD files will be consistently considered)
        spec_paths_request = SyntheticExampleTargetsPerDirectorySpecPathsRequest


    @rule

        request: SyntheticExampleTargetsPerDirectorySpecPathsRequest,
    ) -> SyntheticTargetsSpecPaths:
        # Return all paths we have targets for.
        # This may involve using GlobPaths etc to discover files in the project source tree.
        known_paths = ["src/a/dir1", "src/a/dir2", ...]
        return SyntheticTargetsSpecPaths.from_paths(known_paths)


    @rule
    async def example_synthetic_targets(request: SyntheticExampleTargetsRequest) -> SyntheticAddressMaps:
        # Return targets for `request.path`.

                  (
                    TargetAdaptor("<type-alias>", "<name>", **kwargs),
                    ...
                  ),
