                How to handle imports that don't have an inferrable owner.

                Usually when an import cannot be inferred, it represents an issue like Pants not being
                properly configured, e.g. targets not set up. Often, missing dependencies will result
                in confusing runtime errors like {example_runtime_issue}, so this option can be helpful
                to error more eagerly.
