            which to use:
            {sorted(tgt.address.spec for _name, tgt in compatible_name_and_targets)}

            To fix, either adjust the `{CompatiblePlatformsField.alias}` field from those
            targets so that only one includes the value `{platform.value}`, or change
            `[environments-preview].names` so that it does not define some of those targets.

            It is often useful to still keep the same `local_environment` target definitions in
            BUILD files; instead, do not give a name to each of them in
            `[environments-preview].names` to avoid ambiguity. Then, you can override which target
            a particular name points to by overriding `[environments-preview].names`. For example,
            you could set this in `pants.toml`:

                [environments-preview.names]
                linux = "//:linux_env"
                macos = "//:macos_local_env"

            Then, for CI, override what the name `macos` points to by setting this in
            `pants.ci.toml`:

                [environments-preview.names.add]
                macos = "//:macos_ci_env"

            Locally, you can override `[environments-preview].names` like this by using a
            `.pants.rc` file, for example.
