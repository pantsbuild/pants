# Note: Significant effort has been made to keep the types BuildFile, BuildGraph, Address, and
# Target separated appropriately.  The BuildFileAddressMapper is intended to have knowledge
# of just BuildFile, BuildFileParser and Address.
#
# Here are some guidelines to help maintain this abstraction:
#  - Use the terminology 'address' instead of 'target' in symbols and user messages
#  - Wrap exceptions from BuildFile and BuildFileParser with a subclass of AddressLookupError
#     so that callers do not have to reference those modules
#
# Note: 'spec' should not be a user visible term, substitute 'address' instead.
