        Generates a completion script for the specified shell. The script is printed to stdout.

        For example, `pants complete --zsh > pants-completions.zsh` will generate a zsh
        completion script and write it to the file `my-pants-completions.zsh`. You can then
        source this file in your `.zshrc` file to enable completion for Pants.

        This command is also used by the completion scripts to generate the completion options using
        passthrough options. This usage is not intended for use by end users, but could be
        useful for building custom completion scripts.

        An example of this usage is in the bash completion script, where we use the following command:
        `pants complete -- ${COMP_WORDS[@]}`. This will generate the completion options for the
        current args, and then pass them to the bash completion script.
