    of executing an ordnary goal.

    Only a single daemon goal is executed per run, any remaining goals/arguments are passed
    unaltered to the daemon goal. Daemon goals have precedence over regular goals.

    When multiple daemon goals are presented, the first daemon goal will be used unless there is a
    daemon goal that begin with a hyphen (`-`), in which case the last such "option goal" will be
    prioritized. This is to support things like `./pants some-builtin-goal --help`.

    The intended use for this API is rule code which runs a server (for example, a BSP server)
    which provides an alternate interface to the Pants rule engine.
