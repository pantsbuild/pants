    These are of two types: scoped and unscoped.  Scoped options are explicitly scoped

    may only appear in the appropriate cmd line scope (e.g., ./pants goal.task --foo-bar).

    Technically, any scoped option can appear anywhere, but in practice, having so many
    autocomplete options is more confusing than useful. So, as a heuristic:
     1. In global scope we only autocomplete globally-registered options.
     2. In a goal scope we only autocomplete options registered by any task in that goal.
     3. In a task scope we only autocomplete options registered by that task.
