        the default value by setting `[nfpm].default_mtime` in `pants.toml`,

        `src.project.packaging/deb/projectname_1.2.3+git-1_x86_64.deb`. The other packagers
        have their own formats as well.

        When running `{bin_name()} package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).
