            | rules       | rules       |

        The `pre*` and `post*` scripts are used by `dpkg` at various stages of
        installing, upgrading, and removing the deb package.

        The `config` script and `templates` file are part of the Debian Configuration
        Management Specification. `config` can run at any time, including before
        `preinst` to prompt the user for package configuration using `debconf`.
        `templates` is used by `debconf` to create those prompts.

        The `rules` script is only needed for source packages. This script is an
        executable makefile that can build a binary from the packaged sources.

        Please consult the Debian docs to understand when `dpkg` or `debconf` will
        run each of these scripts, what assumptions you can safely make when they run,
        and how `dpkg` handles a failure.
