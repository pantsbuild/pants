        A list of (virtual) packages or shared libraries that this package provides.

        Each entry can be either a package name or a shared library (which ends
        with ".so"). You can specify a version on both package names and shared
        libraries. If specified, the version must use `=` (not `<`, `<=`, etc).

        Make sure to include any shared libraries (.so files) that this package
        installs if they provide an external API for other packages to use.

        Do not include the 'package_name' (known by 'pkgname' in Archlinux) in
        the list of '{NfpmArchlinuxProvidesField.alias}' as that is implicit.

        For example, package "baz" could declare that it also provides virtual
        packages "foo" and "bar" as well as the "libbaz.so" v2 shared object.
        Because the "baz" package implicitly provides its own name, this list
        should not include "baz".

        install a binary with the same path. Packages that have the same package
        (or virtual package) in both '{NfpmArchlinuxProvidesField.alias}' and
        '{NfpmArchlinuxConflictsField.alias}' are considered alternative packages
        that cannot be installed at the same time. If those package only include
        an entry in '{NfpmArchlinuxProvidesField.alias}' and not in
        '{NfpmArchlinuxConflictsField.alias}', then they CAN be installed at the

        Map of install script source files for the Archlinux package.

        This maps the script type (key) to the script source file (value).
        Each of the script source file(s) must be provided via '{NfpmDependencies.alias}'.
        nFPM will package all of these scripts in a single `.INSTALL` scriptlet file
        by adding a shell function for each of your script files where your script becomes
        the body of that function. These functions are:

            | nFPM script | `.INSTALL` function |
            +-------------+---------------------+
            | preinstall  | pre_install         |
            | postinstall | post_install        |
            | preupgrade  | pre_upgrade         |
            | postupgrade | post_upgrade        |
            | preremove   | pre_remove          |
            | postremove  | post_remove         |

        So, if you provide a `preinstall` script, the `.INSTALL` scriptlet would contain:

            ```
            function pre_install() {{
            # Your preinstall script's contents get embedded here.
            }}
            ```

        Here are several things to keep in mind when writing your scripts:

        * Your scripts are actually functions, so use `return` instead of `exit`.
        * `pacman` uses `/bin/sh` to source `.INSTALL` and run the function(s).
        * `pacman` runs these in a chroot.
        * The current directory is the root of the chroot.

        Please consult the Archlinux docs to understand when `pacman` will run
        each of these functions and what arguments the functions will receive.
