            Support is coming in a future Pants release. In the meantime, the workaround is to host
            the files in a custom repository with `[python-repos]`
            ({doc_url('python-third-party-dependencies#custom-repositories')}).

            You may also run into issues generating lockfiles when using Poetry as the generator,
            rather than Pex. See the option `[python].lockfile_generator` for more
            information.

            This option is mutually exclusive with `[python].requirement_constraints`. We strongly
            recommend using this option because it:

              1. Uses `--hash` to validate that all downloaded files are expected, which reduces\
                the risk of supply chain attacks.
              2. Enforces that all transitive dependencies are in the lockfile, whereas\
                constraints allow you to leave off dependencies. This ensures your build is more\
                stable and reduces the risk of supply chain attacks.
              3. Allows you to have multiple lockfiles in your repository.

            A mapping of logical names to lockfile paths used in your project.

            Many organizations only need a single resolve for their whole project, which is
            a good default and often the simplest thing to do. However, you may need multiple
            resolves, such as if you use two conflicting versions of a requirement in
            your repository.

            If you only need a single resolve, run `{bin_name()} generate-lockfiles` to
            generate the lockfile.

            If you need multiple resolves:

              1. Via this option, define multiple resolve names and their lockfile paths.\
                The names should be meaningful to your repository, such as `data-science` or\
                `pants-plugins`.
              2. Set the default with `[python].default_resolve`.
              3. Update your `python_requirement` targets with the `resolve` field to declare which\
                resolve they should be available in. They default to `[python].default_resolve`,\
                so you only need to update targets that you want in non-default resolves.\
                (Often you'll set this via the `python_requirements` or `poetry_requirements`\
                target generators)
              4. Run `{bin_name()} generate-lockfiles` to generate the lockfiles. If the results\
                aren't what you'd expect, adjust the prior step.
              5. Update any targets like `python_source` / `python_sources`,\
                `python_test` / `python_tests`, and `pex_binary` which need to set a non-default\
                resolve with the `resolve` field.

            If a target can work with multiple resolves, you can either use the `parametrize`
            mechanism or manually create a distinct target per resolve. See {doc_url("targets")}
            for information about `parametrize`.

            For example:

                python_sources(
                    resolve=parametrize("data-science", "web-app"),
                )

            You can name the lockfile paths what you would like; Pants does not expect a
            certain file extension or location.

            Whether to use Pex or Poetry with the `generate-lockfiles` goal.

              2) VCS (Git) requirements.
              3) `[GLOBAL].ca_certs_path`.

            If you use any of these features, you should use Pex.

            Several users have also had issues with how Poetry's lockfile generation handles
            environment markers for transitive dependencies; certain dependencies end up with
            nonsensical environment markers which cause the dependency to not be installed, then
            for Pants/Pex to complain the dependency is missing, even though it's in the
            lockfile. There is a workaround: for `[python].resolves`, manually create a
            `python_requirement` target for the problematic transitive dependencies so that they
            are seen as direct requirements, rather than transitive. For tool lockfiles, add the
            problematic transitive dependency to `[tool].extra_requirements`, e.g.
            `[isort].extra_requirements`. Then, regenerate the lockfile(s) with the
            `generate-lockfiles` goal. Alternatively, use Pex for generation.

            Finally, installing from a Poetry-generated lockfile is slower than installing from a
            Pex lockfile. When using a Pex lockfile, Pants will only install the subset needed
            for the current task.

            However, Pex lockfile generation is a new feature. Given how vast the Python packaging
            ecosystem is, it is possible you may experience edge cases / bugs we haven't yet
            covered. Bug reports are appreciated!
            https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose

            Note that while Pex generates locks in a proprietary JSON format, you can use the
            `{bin_name()} export` goal for Pants to create a virtual environment for
            interoperability with tools like IDEs.

            thanks to performance enhancements we've made. When using Pex lockfiles, you should
            get similar performance to using this option but without the downsides mentioned below.

            Otherwise, if not using Pex lockfiles, this option can improve
            performance and reduce cache size. But it has two consequences: 1) All cached test
            results will be invalidated if any requirement in the lockfile changes, rather
            than just those that depend on the changed requirement. 2) Requirements unneeded

            cause their behavior to change.

            This option does not affect packaging deployable artifacts, such as
