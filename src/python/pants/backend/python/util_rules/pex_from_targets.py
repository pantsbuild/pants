        """Request to create a Pex from the transitive closure of the given addresses.

        :param addresses: The addresses to use for determining what is included in the Pex. The
            transitive closure of these addresses will be used; you only need to specify the roots.
        :param output_filename: The name of the built Pex file, which typically should end in
            `.pex`.
        :param internal_only: Whether we ever materialize the Pex and distribute it directly
            to end users, such as with the `binary` goal. Typically, instead, the user never
            directly uses the Pex, e.g. with `lint` and `test`. If True, we will use a Pex setting
            that results in faster build time but compatibility with fewer interpreters at runtime.
        :param main: The main for the built Pex, equivalent to Pex's `-e` or `-c` flag. If
            left off, the Pex will open up as a REPL.
        :param platforms: Which platforms should be supported. Setting this value will cause
            interpreter constraints to not be used because platforms already constrain the valid
            Python versions, e.g. by including `cp36m` in the platform string.
        :param additional_args: Any additional Pex flags.
        :param additional_args: Any additional Pex flags that should be used with the lockfile.pex.
            Many Pex args like `--emit-warnings` do not impact the lockfile, and setting them
            would reduce reuse with other call sites. Generally, this should only be flags that
            impact lockfile resolution like `--manylinux`.
        :param additional_requirements: Additional requirements to install, in addition to any
            requirements used by the transitive closure of the given addresses.
        :param include_source_files: Whether to include source files in the built Pex or not.
            Setting this to `False` and loading the source files by instead populating the chroot
            and setting the environment variable `PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH` will result in substantially
            fewer rebuilds of the Pex.
        :param include_local_dists: Whether to build local dists and include them in the built pex.
        :param additional_sources: Any additional source files to include in the built Pex.
        :param additional_inputs: Any inputs that are not source files and should not be included
            directly in the Pex, but should be present in the environment when building the Pex.
        :param hardcoded_interpreter_constraints: Use these constraints rather than resolving the
            constraints from the input.
        :param resolve_and_lockfile: if set, use this "named resolve" and lockfile.
        :param direct_deps_only: Only consider the input addresses and their direct dependencies,
            rather than the transitive closure.
        :param description: A human-readable description to render in the dynamic UI when building
            the Pex.
