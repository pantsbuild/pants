        Regardless of whether you use the default or set this field, the path will end with
        PyOxidizer's file format of `<platform>/{{debug,release}}/install/<binary_name>`, where
        `platform` is a Rust platform triplet like `aarch-64-apple-darwin` and `binary_name` is
        the value of the `binary_name` field. So, using the default for this field, the target
        `src/python/project:bin` might have a final path like
        `src.python.project/bin/aarch-64-apple-darwin/release/bin`.

        When running `{bin_name()} package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

        Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.
