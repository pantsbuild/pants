            Use the new Rust-based, multithreaded, in-process dependency parser.

            Pants 2.17 introduced a new paradigm to dependency parsing for Python by leveraging a
            Rust-based parser that's called in the same process as Pants itself, instead of farming
            out to one-python-process-per-file.

            As a result of the switch, cold-cache performance improved by a factor of about 12x,
            while hot-cache had no difference. Additionally, Pants can now infer dependencies from
            Python scripts with syntax errors.

            However, since this parser is completely different it has the potential of introducing
            differences in dependency inference. Although the Pants suite of tests only identified
            differences when using the `# pants: no-infer-dep` pragma, and string-based
            imports/assets, Out of an abundance of caution, this is behind a feature flag that will
            eventually be on-by-default then removed.

            It is recommended that you run `{bin_name()} peek :: > before.json` and then
            `{bin_name()} --python-infer-use-rust-parser peek :: > after.json` and compare the two
            results. If all looks good, set `use_rust_parser` in `[python-infer]` in `pants.toml`.
