"""AnnotationProcessors are java targets that need to run in their own compilation round.

This places them on the classpath of any dependees downstream that may use them. Without
forcing a separate member type we could get a java chunk containing a mix of apt processors and
code that relied on the un-compiled apt processor in the same javac invocation. If so, javac
would not be smart enough to compile the apt processors 1st and activate them.

NB: Having a separate task for this is unnecessary with the isolated compile strategy.
