  Tasks that mix this in are those that run code in a JVM as an implementation detail of
  their operation. Examples are compile.java, checkstyle etc.  This is distinct from tasks
  whose explicit purpose is to run code in a JVM, such as test.junit or jvm.run.  Those
  tasks extend `pants.backend.jvm.tasks.JvmTask`.

  Note that this mixin is typically used by extending `pants.backend.jvm.tasks.NailgunTask`
  rather than being mixed in directly.
