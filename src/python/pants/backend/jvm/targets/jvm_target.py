    :param excludes: List of `exclude <#exclude>`_\s to filter this target's
      transitive dependencies against.
    :param sources: Source code files to build. Paths are relative to the BUILD
      file's directory.
    :type sources: ``Fileset`` (from globs or rglobs) or list of strings
    :param services: A dict mapping service interface names to the classes owned by this target
                     that implement them.  Keys are fully qualified service class names, values are
                     lists of strings, each string the fully qualified class name of a class owned
                     by this target that implements the service interface and should be
                     discoverable by the jvm service provider discovery mechanism described here:
                     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html
    :param str platform: The name of the platform (defined under the jvm-platform subsystem) to use
                         for compilation (that is, a key into the --jvm-platform-platforms
                         dictionary). If unspecified, the platform will default to the first one of
                         these that exist: (1) the default_platform specified for jvm-platform,
                         (2) a platform constructed from whatever java version is returned by
                         DistributionLocator.cached().version.
    :param bool strict_deps: When True, only the directly declared deps of the target will be used
                             at compilation time. This enforces that all direct deps of the target
                             are declared, and can improve compilation speed due to smaller
                             classpaths. Transitive deps are always provided at runtime.
    :param list exports: A list of exported targets, which will be accessible to dependents even
                         with strict_deps turned on. A common use case is for library targets to
                         to export dependencies that it knows its dependents will need. Then any
                         dependents of that library target will have access to those dependencies
                         even when strict_deps is True. Note: exports is transitive, which means
                         dependents have access to the closure of exports. An example will be that
                         if A exports B, and B exports C, then any targets that depends on A will
                         have access to both B and C.
    :param bool fatal_warnings: Whether to turn warnings into errors for this target.  If present,
                                takes priority over the language's fatal-warnings option.
    :param bool zinc_file_manager: Whether to use zinc provided file manager that allows
                                   transactional rollbacks, but in certain cases may conflict with
                                   user libraries.
    :param javac_plugins: names of compiler plugins to use when compiling this target with javac.
    :param dict javac_plugin_args: Map from javac plugin name to list of arguments for that plugin.
    :param scalac_plugins: names of compiler plugins to use when compiling this target with scalac.
    :param dict scalac_plugin_args: Map from scalac plugin name to list of arguments for that plugin.
