                     lists of strings, each string the fully qualified class name of a class owned
                     by this target that implements the service interface and should be
                     discoverable by the jvm service provider discovery mechanism described here:

                         dictionary). If unspecified, the platform will default to the first one of

                             are declared, and can improve compilation speed due to smaller
                             classpaths. Transitive deps are always provided at runtime.
    :param bool fatal_warnings: Whether to turn warnings into errors for this target.  If present,
                                takes priority over the language's fatal-warnings option.
    :param bool zinc_file_manager: Whether to use zinc provided file manager that allows
                                   transactional rollbacks, but in certain cases may conflict with
                                   user libraries.
