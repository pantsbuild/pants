class JvmPrepCommand(RuntimePlatformMixin, JvmTarget):
    """A command (defined in a Java target) that must be run before other tasks in a goal.

    For example, you can use `jvm_prep_command()` to execute a script that sets up tunnels to database
    servers. These tunnels could then be leveraged by integration tests.

    You can define a jvm_prep_command() target as follows:

      jvm_prep_command(
        name='foo',
        goal='test',
        mainclass='com.example.myproject.BeforeTestMain',
        args=['--foo', 'bar'],
        jvm_options=['-Xmx256M', '-Dmy.property=baz'],
        dependencies=[
          'myproject/src/main/java:lib',
        ],
      )

    Pants will execute the `jvm_prep_command()` when processing the specified goal.  They will be
    triggered when running targets that depend on the `prep_command()` target or when the
    target is referenced from the command line.

    See also prep_command for running shell commands.
