# should not be depending on a scala-compile keys.  There should also be a more disciplined notion
# of target platform version from which default deps could be derived.  A technical hurdle is that
# the currency is dep specs today which forces emitting a BUILD file containing the default spec
# pointee targets to achieve true works-from-default operation.
