0.0.58 (11/13/2015)
-------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release completes the deprecated cycle for two options and removes them:

* `--infer-test-from-siblings` for `eclipse` and `idea` goals
* `--strategy` for various code generation tasks like protoc

Two existing tasks not installed by default have been moved from `pantsbuild.pants` to
`pantsbuild.pants.contrib.python.checks`.  You can add `pantsbuild.pants.contrib.python.checks` to
your `plugins` list in `pants.ini` to get these tasks installed and start verifying your python
BUILD deps and to check that your python code conforms to pep8 and various other lints.

0.0.50 (9/25/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release removes the 'global' jvm compile strategy in favor of the 'isolated' strategy and
switches the default java incremental compilation frontend from jmake to zinc.  If you were using
'global' and/or jmake you'll have some pants.ini cleanup to do.  You can run the migration tool
from the `pantsbuild/pants repository <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants>`_ by cloning the repo
and running the following command from there against your own repo's pants.ini::

    pantsbuild/pants $ ./pants run migrations/options/src/python:migrate_config -- [path to your repo's pants.ini]

There have been several additional deprecated APIs removed in this release, please review the

0.0.48 (9/18/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new UI in the `./pants server` web interface that shows 'Timing Stats' graphs.  These
graphs show where time is spent on a daily-aggregation basis in various tasks.  You can drill down
into a task to see which sub-steps are most expensive.  Try it out!

We also have a few new metadata goals to help figure out what's going on with file ownership and
options.

If you want to find out where options are coming from, the `options` goal can help you out::

    $ ./pants -q options --only-overridden --scope=compile
    compile.apt.jvm_options = ['-Xmx1g', '-XX:MaxPermSize=256m'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.java.jvm_options = ['-Xmx2G'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.java.partition_size_hint = 1000000000 (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.zinc.jvm_options = ['-Xmx2g', '-XX:MaxPermSize=256m', '-Dzinc.analysis.cache.limit=0'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)

If you're not sure which target(s) own a given file::

    $ ./pants -q list-owners -- src/python/pants/base/target.py
    src/python/pants/build_graph

The latter comes from new contributor Tansy Arron-Walker.

0.0.47 (9/11/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By defaulting the versions of most built-in tools, this release makes pants significantly easier to configure! Tools like antlr, jmake, nailgun, etc, will use default classpaths unless override targets are provided.

Additionally, this release adds native support for shading JVM binaries, which helps to isolate them from their deployment environment.

Thanks to all contributors!

0.0.46 (9/4/2015)
-----------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release includes more support for Node.js!

Support for the environment variables `PANTS_VERBOSE` and `PANTS_BUILD_ROOT` have been removed in
this release.  Instead, use `--level` to turn on debugging in pants.  Pants recursively searches from
the current directory to the root directory until it finds the `pants.ini` file in order to find
the build root.

The `pants()` syntax in BUILD files has been removed (deprecated since 0.0.29).

0.0.44 (8/21/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this release Go support should be considered beta.  Most features you'd expect are implemented
including a `buildgen.go` task that can maintain your Go BUILD files as inferred from just
`go_binary` target definitions.  Yet to come is `doc` goal integration and an option to wire
in-memory `buildgen.go` as an implicit bootstrap task in any pants run that includes Go targets.

Also in this release is improved control over the tools pants uses, in particular JVM selection
control.

0.0.43 (8/19/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release makes the isolated jvm compile strategy viable out-of-the-box for use with large
dependency graphs. Without it, `test.junit` and `run.jvm` performance slows down significantly
due to the large number of loose classfile directories.

Please try it out in your repo by grabbing a copy of `pants.ini.isolated
<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/pants.ini.isolated>`_ and using a command like::

    ./pants --config-override=pants.ini.isolated test examples/{src,tests}/{scala,java}/::

You'll like the results.  Just update your own `pants.ini` with the pants.ini.isolated settings to
use it by default!

In the medium term, we're interested in making the isolated strategy the default jvm compilation
strategy, so your assistance and feedback is appreciated!

Special thanks to Stu Hood and Nick Howard for lots of work over the past months to get this point.
