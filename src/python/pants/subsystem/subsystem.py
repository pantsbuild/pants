  """A separable piece of functionality that may be reused across multiple tasks or other code.

  Subsystems encapsulate the configuration and initialization of things like JVMs,
  Python interpreters, SCMs and so on.

  Subsystem instances are tied to option scopes. For example, a singleton subsystem that all tasks
  share is tied to the global scope, while a private instance used by just one task is tied to
  that task's scope.

  A Subsystem instance initializes itself from options in a subscope (the 'qualified scope') of
  the scope it's tied to. For example, a global SubsystemFoo instance gets its options from
  scope 'foo', while a SubsystemFoo instance for use just in task bar.baz gets its options from
  scope 'bar.baz.foo'.
