This page describes the developer workflow when changing Pants itself. (If you
wanted instructions for using Pants to develop other programs, please see
:doc:`first_tutorial`.)

.. Getting the source code section.


********************
Running from sources
********************

As pants is implemented in python it can be run directly from sources.
Use the ``pants.bootstrap`` script. ::

   $ PANTS_DEV=1 ./pants.bootstrap goal goals
   *** running pants in dev mode from ./src/python/pants/bin/pants_exe.py ***
   <remainder of output omitted for brevity>

Notice this invocation specifies the ``PANTS_DEV`` environment variable.
By defining ``PANTS_DEV`` pants will be run from sources.


********************
Building a Pants PEX
********************

While you can build a Pants PEX in the usual Python way, ``pants.bootstrap``
is a nice wrapper. If you call it without the ``PANTS_DEV=1``
environment described above, it

   * Checks the source tree's top directory for a ``pants.pex`` and runs it
     if it exists. Otherwise ``pants.bootstrap``...
   * Builds a new ``pants.pex``, moves it to the source tree's top
     directory, and runs that.

It looks something like::

   $ rm pants.pex
   $ ./pants.bootstrap goal my-new-feature
   Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonBinary(src/python/pants/BUILD:pants)])
   Building PythonBinary PythonBinary(src/python/pants/BUILD:pants):
   Wrote /Users/travis/src/science/dist/pants.pex
   AMAZING NEW FEATURE PRINTS HERE
   $ ls pants.pex # gets moved here, though originally "Wrote" to ./dist/
   pants.pex
   $ ./pants.bootstrap goal my-new-feature
   AMAZING NEW FEATURE PRINTS HERE

Using ``./pants.bootstrap`` to launch Pants thus
gives a handy workflow: generate ``pants.pex``. Go back and forth
between trying the generated ``pants.pex`` and fixing source code
as inspired by its misbehaviors. When the fixed source code is in a
consistent state, remove ``pants.pex`` so that it will get replaced
on the next ``pants.bootstrap`` run.

(The ``./pants`` launcher, like ``./pants.bootstrap``, checks for a
``pants.pex`` in the source tree's top directory and uses that ``pants.pex``
if found.)

Running Tests
=============

Pants has many tests. There are BUILD targets to run those tests.
We try to keep them passing.
To make sure a change passes *all* of Pants' tests, use the
``tests/python/pants_test:all`` target.
*Do not* use ``PANTS_DEV=1`` when running tests at this time
as that modifies ``sys.path`` in such a way as resources will
not be discovered correctly. ::

   ./pants.bootstrap tests/python/pants_test:all

To try all the tests in a few configurations, you can run the same script
that our Travis CI does. This can take a while, but it's a good idea to
run it before you contribute a change or merge it to master::

   ./build-support/bin/ci.sh

Before :doc:`contributing a change <howto_contribute>` to Pants,
make sure it passes all tests.

For convenience, some other test targets enable more granular test running.
Please see the BUILD files for details.
