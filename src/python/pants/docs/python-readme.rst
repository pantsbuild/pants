Python Projects with Pants
##########################

Pants makes the manipulation and distribution of hermetically sealed Python
environments painless.
You can organize your code in the :doc:`Pants way <first_concepts>`,
with targets for binaries, libraries, and tests.
Pants builds Python code into
`PEXes <https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/python/twitter/common/python/README.md>`_.
(A PEX is, roughly, an archive file containing a runnable Python environment.)
Pants isn't the only PEX-generation tool out there; but if you have some
"common code" used by more than one PEX, Pants makes it easy to manage
the dependencies.

This page assumes that you've already read :doc:`first_tutorial`.

Pants' Python support changed in 2014. Depending on how old your Pants is,
Pants goals might not work with Python code. If you use older pants,
please see :doc:`python_old`.

Pants' Python support is still changing. Depending on what you're trying to
do, your Pants command might start with ``goal`` or might start with something
else.

**************************
Relevant Goals and Targets
**************************

**Runnable Binary**

  Pants can generate PEXes, executables built from Python.
  Invoke the :ref:`binary goal <gref_goal_binary>`
  on a :ref:`python_binary <bdict_python_binary>`
  target to generate a ``.pex``. You can also invoke the
  :ref:`run goal <gref_goal_run>`
  on a ``python_binary`` to run its code "in place."

**Importable Code**

  :ref:`python_library <bdict_python_library>` BUILD targets make Python code
  "import-able".
  The rule of thumb is that each directory of ``.py`` files has a
  ``BUILD`` file with a ``python_library`` target. A Python target
  that has a ``python_library`` in its ``dependencies`` can import
  its code.

  To use code that's not in your workspace, use a
  :ref:`python_requirement_library <bdict_python_requirement_library>`
  and a :ref:`python_requirement <bdict_python_requirement>` to
  refer to the code.
  To use several several of these via a ``pip``-style
  ``requirements.txt`` file, use a
  :ref:`python_requirements <bdict_python_requirements>`.

**Tests**

  A :ref:`python_tests <bdict_python_tests>` BUILD target has some
  ``pytest`` tests. It normally
  depends on a ``python_library`` target so it can import and test
  the library's code. Use the :ref:`test goal <gref_goal_test>`
  to run these tests.

**Generated Code**

  A :ref:`python_thrift_library <bdict_python_thrift_library>`
  generates Python code from ``.thrift`` source;
  a Python target that has this target in its ``dependencies`` can ``import``
  the generated Python code.

*************************
BUILD for a Simple Binary
*************************

The pantsbuild/pants repo has a simple "hello world" sample Python binary.
You can use ``goal binary`` to build a PEX from it.
You can then run the PEX::

    $ ./pants goal binary examples/src/python/example/hello/main
         ...much output...
    $ ./dist/main.pex # run the generated PEX
    Hello, world!
    $

``examples/src/python/example/hello/main/BUILD`` defines a ``python_binary`` target,
a build-able thing that configures a runnable program made from Python code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/src/python/example/hello/main/BUILD
   :start-after: Like Hello

This binary has a source file with its "main". A Python binary's "main" can be
in a depended-upon ``python_library`` or in the ``python_binary``\'s
``source``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/src/python/example/hello/main/main.py
   :start-after: Apache License

This code imports code from another target.
To make this work, the binary target has a dependency
``examples/src/python/example/hello/greet`` and the Python
code imports ``example/hello/greet``.

You remember that libraries configure "importable" code;
``example/hello/greet/BUILD`` has a ``python_library``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/src/python/example/hello/greet/BUILD
   :start-after: Like Hello

This ``python_library`` pulls in ``greet.py``\'s Python code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/src/python/example/hello/greet/greet.py
   :start-after: Apache

To test the library's code, we set up
``examples/tests/python/example_test/hello/greet/BUILD`` with a ``python_tests``
target. It depends on the library:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tests/python/example_test/hello/greet/greet.py
   :start-after: Apache License

Use ``goal test`` to run the tests::

    $ ./pants goal test examples/tests/python/example_test/hello/greet

    13:29:28 00:00 [main]
                   (To run a reporting server: ./pants goal server)
    13:29:28 00:00   [bootstrap]
    13:29:28 00:00   [setup]
    13:29:28 00:00     [parse]
       ...
    13:29:29 00:01   [test]
    13:29:29 00:01     [pytest]

*******************************
Handling ``python_requirement``
*******************************

``BUILD`` files specify outside Python dependencies via
:ref:`python_requirement_library <bdict_python_requirement_library>`
targets wrapping
:ref:`python_requirement <bdict_python_requirement>`\s.

Pants handles these dependencies for you.
It never installs anything globally.
Instead, it builds the dependencies, caches them in `.pants.d`,
and assembles them *a la carte* into an execution environment.

************
PEX Contents
************

To build a PEX, invoke ``./pants goal binary`` on a ``python_binary`` target:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./pants goal binary examples/src/python/example/hello/main
    ...
                   SUCCESS
  $ ./dist/main.pex
    Hello, world!

Though the binary itself specifies just one dependency, the transitive
closure of hello/main's dependencies pulled in
hello/greet and, in turn, hello/greet's dependencies.
Pants bundles up the closed set of all dependencies into
into the PEX.

*************************************************
REPL and environment manipulation with `pants py`
*************************************************

Pants has a "py" command that lets you manipulate the environments
described by `python_binary` and `python_library` targets, such as drop into
an interpreter with the environment set up for you.
Note that's "py", **not** "goal py".

``pants py <target>``...

1. For a ``python_binary`` target, builds the environment and executes the
   target.
2. For `python_library` targets, builds the environment that is the transitive
   closure of all targets and drops into an interpreter.
3. For a combination of `python_binary` and `python_library` targets, builds
   the transitive closure of all targets and executes the first binary target.

Let's drop into our library target ``examples/src/python/example/hello/greet``
with verbosity turn on to see what's going on in the background::

    $ PANTS_VERBOSE=1 ./pants py examples/src/python/example/hello/greet
    /Users/lhosken/workspace/pants examples/src/python/example/hello/greet
    Building chroot for [PythonLibrary(BuildFileAddress(/Users/lhosken/workspace/pants/examples/src/python/example/hello/greet/BUILD, greet))]:
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(BuildFileAddress(/Users/lhosken/workspace/pants/examples/src/python/example/hello/greet/BUILD, greet))
      Dumping requirement: ansicolors==1.0.2
      Dumping distribution: .../ansicolors-1.0.2-py2-none-any.whl
    Python 2.6.8 (unknown, Mar  9 2014, 22:16:00)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>>

Pants loads ``ansicolors`` (greet's 3rdparty dependency). It would have fetched
this dependency over the network if necessary. (It wasn't necessary to download
``ansicolors``; Pants already fetched it while "bootstrapping" itself.)

You can convince yourself that the environment contains all the dependencies
by inspecting `sys.path` and importing libraries as you desire::

  >>> from example.hello.greet.greet import greet
  >>> greet("escape codes")
  u'\x1b[32mHello, escape codes!\x1b[0m'
  >>> from colors import red
  >>> red("other escape codes")
  '\x1b[31mother escape codes\x1b[0m'

**Dependencies built by Pants are never installed globally**.
These dependencies only exist for the duration of the Python
interpreter forked by Pants.

``pants py --pex``
==================

You can use ``./pants py --pex`` to build a PEX
file from ``python_library`` targets with no
`python_binary` target.  Since there is no entry point
specified, the resulting ``.pex`` file just behaves like a Python interpreter,
but with the sys.path bootstrapped for you::

    $ ./pants py --pex examples/src/python/example/hello/greet
    /Users/lhosken/workspace/pants examples/src/python/example/hello/greet
    Wrote /Users/lhosken/workspace/pants/dist/src.python.example.hello.greet.greet.pex
    $

If you run ``dist/src.python.example.hello.greet.greet.pex``, since it has
no entry point, it drops you into an interpreter::

    $ ./dist/src.python.example.hello.greet.greet.pex
    Python 2.6.8 (unknown, Mar  9 2014, 22:16:00)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>> from example.hello.greet.greet import greet
    >>> greet("pex")
    u'\x1b[32mHello, pex!\x1b[0m'
    >>>

It's like a single-file lightweight alternative to a virtualenv.
We can even use it to run our `main.py` application::

    $ dist/src.python.example.hello.greet.greet.pex examples/src/python/example/hello/main/main.py
    Hello, world!
    $

This can be an incredibly powerful and lightweight way to manage and deploy
virtual environments without using `virtualenv`.

*************************
python_binary entry_point
*************************

An advanced feature of `python_binary` targets, you may in addition specify
direct entry points into PEX files rather than a source file.  For example,
if we wanted to build an a la carte `fab` wrapper for fabric::

  python_binary(name = "fab",
    entry_point = "fabric.main:main",
    dependencies = [
      "3rdparty/python:fabric",
    ]
  )


We build:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./pants src/python/fabwrap:fab
  ...
  Wrote /private/tmp/wickman-pants/dist/fab.pex

And now `dist/fab.pex` behaves like a standalone `fab` binary:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ dist/fab.pex -h
  Usage: fab [options] <command>[:arg1,arg2=val2,host=foo,hosts='h1;h2',...] ...

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -d NAME, --display=NAME
                          print detailed info about command NAME
    -F FORMAT, --list-format=FORMAT
                          formats --list, choices: short, normal, nested
    -l, --list            print list of possible commands and exit
    --set=KEY=VALUE,...   comma separated KEY=VALUE pairs to set Fab env vars
    --shortlist           alias for -F short --list
    -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
    -a, --no_agent        don't use the running SSH agent
    -A, --forward-agent   forward local agent to remote end
    --abort-on-prompts    abort instead of prompting (for password, host, etc)
    ...

***********************
More About Python Tests
***********************

Pants runs Python tests with ``pytest``. You can pass CLI options to ``pytest``
with ``--test-pytest-options``. For example, to only run tests whose names
match the pattern \*foo\*, you could run ::

    $ ./pants goal test examples/tests/python/example_test/hello/greet --test-pytest-options='-k foo'
    ...
                     ============== test session starts ===============

               SUCCESS


Code Coverage
=============

To get code coverage data, set the `PANTS_PY_COVERAGE` environment variable::

    $ PANTS_PY_COVERAGE=1 ./pants examples/tests/python/example_test/hello/greet:greet

This uses the `python_tests.coverage` target attribute to determine what modules to measure
coverage against for each `python_tests` target run.  If the attribute is not present it's assumed
the coverage should be measured over the same packages that house the test target's sources. This
heuristic only works with parallel source and test package structures and reliance upon it is
discouraged.

There are 2 alternatives to specifying `coverage` attributes on all `python_tests` targets, but both
override any existing `coverage` attributes in-play to form a global coverage specification for the
test run.

`PANTS_PY_COVERAGE=modules:[module1](,...,[moduleN])` allows specification of package or module
names to track coverage against.  For example::

  $ PANTS_PY_COVERAGE=modules:example.hello.greet,example.hello.main ./pants ...

This would measure coverage against all python code in the `example.hello.greet` and
`example.hello.main`. It ignores coverage attributes.

Similarly, a set of base paths can be specified containing the code for coverage to be measured
over::

  $ PANTS_PY_COVERAGE=paths:example/hello ./pants ...

In this case the paths should be relative to the source root housing the python code; for this
example, `examples/src/python`.

Interactive Debugging on Test Failure
=====================================

You can invoke the Python debugger on a test failure by
leaving out the ``goal test`` and passing ``--pdb``.
This can be useful for
inspecting the state of objects especially if you are mocking interfaces.

****************************************************
Manipulating PEX behavior with environment variables
****************************************************

You can alter a PEX file's behavior during invocation
by setting some environment variables.

PEX_INTERPRETER=1
=================

If you have a PEX file with a prescribed executable source or ``entry_point``,
you can still drop into an interpreter with the environment bootstrapped.
Set `PEX_INTERPRETER=1` in your environment, and the PEX bootstrapper
skips any execution and instead launches an interactive interpreter session.

PEX_VERBOSE=1
=============

If your environment is failing to bootstrap or simply bootstrapping very slowly, it can be useful to
set `PEX_VERBOSE=1` in your environment to get debugging output printed to the console.  Debugging output
includes:

1. Fetched dependencies
2. Built dependencies
3. Activated dependencies
4. Packages scrubbed out of `sys.path`
5. The `sys.path` used to launch the interpreter

PEX_MODULE=entry_point
======================

If you have a PEX file without a prescribed entry point, or want to change
the ``entry_point`` for a single invocation, you can set
``PEX_MODULE=entry_point`` using the same format as described in the
:ref:`python_binary <bdict_python_binary>` Pants target.

This can be useful for bundling up some packages together and
using that single file to execute scripts from each of them.

Another common pattern is to link `pytest` into your PEX file, and run
``PEX_MODULE=pytest my_pex.pex tests/*.py`` to run your test suite in its
isolated environment.

PEX_COVERAGE
============

There is nascent support for performing code coverage within PEX files by
setting `PEX_COVERAGE=<suffix>`.  By default the coverage files will be written
into the current working directory with the file pattern `.coverage.<suffix>`.  This
requires that the `coverage` Python module has been linked into your PEX.

You can then combine the coverage files by running `PEX_MODULE=coverage
my_pex.pex .coverage.suffix*` and run a report using `PEX_MODULE=coverage
my_pex.pex report`.  Since PEX files are just zip files, `coverage` is able
to understand and extract source and line numbers from them in order to
produce coverage reports.
