Developing a Pants Plugin
=========================

*As of September 2014, this process is new and still evolving;* *expect
it to change somewhat.*

This page documents how to develop a Pants plugin, a set of code that
defines new Pants functionality. If you
[[develop a new task|pants('src/python/pants/docs:dev_tasks')]]
or target to add to Pants (or to
override an existing part of Pants), a plugin gives you a way to
register your code with Pants.

Much of Pants' own functionality is organized in plugins; see them in
[`src/python/pants/backend/*`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/src/python/pants/backend).

A plugin registers its functionality with Pants by defining some
functions in a `register.py` file in its top directory. For example,
Pants' `jvm` code registers in
[src/python/pants/backend/jvm/register.py](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/register.py)
Pants' backend-loader code assumes your plugin has a `register.py` file
there.

Simple Configuration
--------------------

If you want to extend Pants without adding any 3rd Party libraries that aren't already referenced by
Pants, you can use the following technique using sources stored directly
in your repo.  All you need to do is add the directory where your plugin sources are stored
to `PYTHONPATH` and put the package where the plugin is defined in `pants.ini`.

In the example below, the stock `maven_layout()` function will be extended by adding extra source
root definitions and library types.

- Define a home for your plugins. In this example we'll use a directory named 'plugins'

- Create an empty  `plugins/ext_maven_layout/__init__.py` to define your python package.

- Create a python module `plugins/ext_maven_layout/ext_maven_layout.py` that creates a new function
to enhance `maven_layout()`:

        :::python
        # ext_maven_layout/ext_maven_layout.py
        import os

        from pants.backend.codegen.targets.java_wire_library import JavaWireLibrary
        from pants.backend.jvm.targets.jar_library import JarLibrary
        from pants.backend.maven_layout.maven_layout import maven_layout
        from pants.base.source_root import SourceRoot

        def ext_maven_layout(parse_context, basedir=''):
         """Sets up typical maven project source roots for all built-in pants target types.

         See maven_layout() defined in the pants source code. Appends additional roots and targets
         to the stock version.
         """
         def root(path, *types):
           SourceRoot.register_mutable(os.path.join(parse_context.rel_path, basedir, path), *types)

         # Use the stock maven_layout to get started
         maven_layout(parse_context, basedir=basedir)

         # Add additional targets to existing source roots
         root('src/main/java', JarLibrary)
         root('src/test/java', JarLibrary)

         # Add additional source roots
         root('src/main/wire_proto', JavaWireLibrary, JarLibrary)
         root('src/test/wire_proto', JavaWireLibrary, JarLibrary)


- Create `plugins/ext_maven_layout/register.py` to register the functions in your plugin.  When registering a
backend in pants.ini, register.py is used by the pants plugin api  to register new functions
exposed in build files, targets, tasks and goals:

        :::python
        # plugins/ext_maven_layout/register.py

        from pants.build_graph.build_file_aliases import BuildFileAliases
        from ext_maven_layout.ext_maven_layout import ext_maven_layout

        def build_file_aliases():
         return BuildFileAliases(
           context_aware_object_factories={
            'ext_maven_layout': BuildFileAliases.curry_context(ext_maven_layout)
           }
         )

- Update your `pants` wrapper script to include the `plugins/` directory on `PYTHONPATH`:

        :::bash
        PYTHONPATH=plugins:${PYTHONPATH}
        export PYTHONPATH

- In `pants.ini`, add your new plugins directory to the list of backends to load when pants starts.
This instructs pants to look for a module named `ext_maven_layout.register` and invoke
it.

        :::python
        [DEFAULT]
        backend_packages: [
            "ext_maven_layout",
          ]

Examples from `twitter/commons`
-------------------------------

For an example of a code repo with plugins to add features to Pants when building in that repo,
take a look at [`twitter/commons`](https://github.com/twitter/commons), especially its
[`pants-plugin` directory](https://github.com/twitter/commons).

This repo has a [`pants` wrapper script](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants)
that script adds `pants-plugins/src/python` to `PYTHONPATH`.

The repo's [`pants.ini` file](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants) has a
`backend_packages` entry listing the plugin packages (packages with `register.py` files):

    :::python
    [DEFAULT]
    backend_packages: [
        'twitter.common.pants.jvm.args',
        'twitter.common.pants.jvm.extras',
        'twitter.common.pants.python.commons',
    ]

The [`...jvm/extras/register.py`](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants-plugins/src/python/twitter/common/pants/jvm/extras/register.py)
file registers a `checkstyle` goal. To find the code for this task, come back to the
`pantsbuild/pants` repo: Pants defines the
[`Checkstyle` task class](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/tasks/checkstyle.py) but doesn't register it. But other Pants workspaces can register it, as
`twitter/commons` illustrates.

The [`...jvm/args/register.py`](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants-plugins/src/python/twitter/common/pants/jvm/args/register.py)
registers a goal, `args-apt`. This plugin also defines the
[`Task` class for this goal](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants-plugins/src/python/twitter/common/pants/jvm/args/tasks/resource_mapper.py).

(Somewhat confusingly, `twitter/commons`' has a `BUILD` file so it can publish its plugins as a
`setup_py` artifact. If you only use your plugin to build code in the *same* workspace,
your plugin directory tree does *not* need any `BUILD` files. By publishing this plugin, Twitter can
use its code in other workspaces, e.g., Twitter's internal codebase. Other folks can use it too:
introduce a dependency on `twitter.common.pants` and add entries to their `pants.ini backend_packages`
section.)
