Pants Internals
###############

Pants is a build tool. This document describes some of its internals,
concentrating on how to tailor Pants to your needs, such as integrating it with
other tools.

If you want to run Pants or to write BUILD files, you probably want
the :doc:`first_concepts` instead.  But if you want to support a new tool or a
new language, read on.

*********************************
How Some Base Classes Interrelate
*********************************

**Target**
    An addressable thing, such as a :mod:`python_binary` or :mod:`scala_tests`.
    To add support for a new language, you probably want to add new target types
    to represent things you can build with that language. Most Target instances can
    depend on other Target instances. As a rule of thumb, if code in Target _A_
    imports code in Target *B*, then *A* depends on *B*. If *A*
    depends on *B*, then when carrying out some goal on *A*, you can be sure that
    goal has been carried out on *B*.

    TODO: if there are one or more exemplary Target classes, link to them.

**goal** a.k.a. **Phase**
    From the users' point of view, when they invoke
    `pants test binary src/python/mach_turtle` the "goals" are `test` and `binary`,
    the actions requested. Internally, these are implemented in terms of
    Goals, Phases, and Tasks. Confusingly (and hopefully to be changed), the
    things that the user calls "goals" are actually Phases. A Phase has one or
    more Goals:

**Goal**
    The glue that binds Phases and Tasks together. A Phase has one or
    more Goals. A Goal has a Task, which does the actual work of invoking tools.
    A `compile` Phase, for example, could contain a Goal for Python
    compilation, a Goal for Java compilation, etc.; each of those Goals has
    one Task. If you want an existing Phase to do something new, instead of
    cramming your code into an existing Goal, you probably want to define a new
    Goal and `install` it in the existing Phase. A Goal can depend on Phases,
    expressing that Pants should carry out those Phases before carrying out the
    Goal. For example, the java-test Goal depends on the `compile` Phase because
    testing uncompiled code is hard.

**Task**
    The thing that does the actual work for some Goal. It looks
    at the environment and Targets, invokes some tool, generates things, and reports
    success/failure. It can define command-line flags to check.
    If you're giving Pants the ability to do something new, you're probably
    adding a Task. See :doc:`dev_tasks`.

**Context**
    An API to the state of the world. A Task uses this to find out
    things like the flags the user set on the command line, `pants.ini` config,
    and the state of the build cache. The task uses `context.products` to
    communicate results and requests for build results.

*********************************
Examining a Phase-Goal-Task Chain
*********************************

It's not so easy to figure out in your head which Goals+Tasks are
invoked for some command line command.  The dependency relationships
between Phases, Goals, and Tasks can get complex.  The `--explain`
flag helps here. Instead of building something, it echoes a summary of
the phases, goals, and tasks it would use to build something. For
example, you can find out what happens on a `compile`::

    $./pants goal compile --explain
    Phase Execution Order:
    
    resolve-idl -> thriftstore-codegen -> gen -> resolve -> compile
    
    Phase [Goal->Task] Order:
    
    resolve-idl [idl->IdlResolve, extract->Extract]
    thriftstore-codegen [thriftstore-codegen->ThriftstoreCodeGen]
    gen [thrift->ThriftGen, scrooge->ScroogeGen, protoc->ProtobufGen, antlr->AntlrGen
    resolve [ivy->IvyResolve]
    compile [checkstyle->Checkstyle]
    $

This tells you that the `resolve` phase comes before the `compile` phase, the
`gen` phase comes before that, etc. There is more than one Goal registered for
the `gen` phase. In the `gen [thrift->ThriftGen,...` text, `thrift` is
the name of a Goal and `ThriftGen` is the name of its Task class.

********************
Defining a Goal/Task
********************

Defining a new Goal (meant here in the glue-that-binds-Phases-and-Tasks sense)
tells Pants of some new action it can take. This might
be a new phase or adding new meaning for an old phase (e.g., telling
the "gen" code-generation phase about some new way to generate code).

A task can mutate the target graph. If it, say, generates some Java code
from some other language, it can create a Java target and make things that
depended on an ``otherlang_gen`` target instead depend on the created
Java target. 

.. Where to Put it
   ===============
   TODO: this

Basic Task
==========

A Goal's ``Task`` is the class that does the "work".
When you define a new ``Task`` class, you'll want to have at least

* ``setup_parser(cls, option_group, args, mkflag)``
  Defines command-line flags user can use.
* ``__init__(self, context)``
  The ``context`` encapsulates the outside world.
  It has values of command-line flags for this invocation;
  an API to see configuration from :ref:`pants.ini <setup-pants-ini>`;
  a way to get files that are products of other build steps.
* ``execute(self, targets)``
  Actually do something; perhaps generate some products from some sources.

There are some base ``Task`` classes to help you get started. E.g., if your
goal just outputs information to the console, subclass ``ConsoleTask``.

Group
=====

A few ``Goal``\s have group parameters. Specifically, the JVM compile goals::

  goal(name='scalac',
       action=ScalaCompile,
       group=group('jvm', is_scala),
       dependencies=['gen', 'resolve']).install('compile').with_description(
         'Compile both generated and checked in code.'
       )
  goal(name='apt',
       action=JavaCompile,
       group=group('jvm', is_apt),
       dependencies=['gen', 'resolve']).install('compile')
  goal(name='javac',
       action=JavaCompile,
       group=group('jvm', is_java),
       dependencies=['gen', 'resolve']).install('compile')

A goal normally operates on one target at a time.
But some tools, e.g., ``javac`` can operate on many many inputs with one
invocation. Such tools might be more efficient used that way.
Perhaps there's a lot of overhead starting up the tool, but it takes
about as long to compile 10 source files as to compile one.
A ``goal`` with a ``group`` will try to operate on more than one target at
a time.

***********
Code Layout
***********

`./ <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/base/>`_
  Top-level directory  
  **`__init__.py`** Among other things, defines the symbols
  visible in `BUILD` files. If you add a
  Target type, this file should import it.  
  **`BUILD`** Dogfood and/or recursion.  
  **`*.md`** Docs too important for `docs/`.

`base <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/base/>`_
  Defines `Target` and other fundamental pieces/base classes.
  As a rule of thumb, code in ``base`` shouldn't ``import`` anything in
  non-base Pants; but many things in non-base Pants ``import`` from ``base``.
  If you're editing code in ``base`` and find yourself referring to
  the JVM (or other target-language-specific things), you're probably editing
  the wrong thing and want to look further up the inheritance tree.

`bin <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/bin/>`_
  The "main" of Pants itself lives here.

`commands <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/commands/>`_
  Before we had goals we had commands, and they lived here.  
  **goal.py** Many Goals and Phases are defined here.

`docs <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/docs/>`_
  Documentation. The source of this very document you're reading now lives here.

`goal <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/goal/>`_
  The source of `Context`, `Goal`, and `Phase` (some
  important classes) lives here. If you extend pants to work with other
  tools/languages, hopefully you won't need to edit these; but you'll
  probably look at them to see the flow of control.

`java <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/java/>`_
  (TODO OMG bluffing) Utility classes useful to many things that work
  with Java code.

`python <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/python/>`_
  (TODO OMG bluffing) Utility classes useful to many things that work
  with Python code.

`targets <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/targets/>`_
  Source of the Target classes; e.g., the code behind `jvm_binary`
  lives here. If you define a new Target type, add its code here.

`tasks <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/pants/tasks/>`_
  Source of the Task classes. E.g., `junit_run`, the code that
  invokes JUnit if someone tests a `java_tests` target.

`tests/.../pants <https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/tests/python/pants_test/>`_
  Tests for Pants. These tend to be ``python_tests`` exercising Pants functions.
  ``pants_test.base_build_root_test.BaseBuildRootTest`` is a very handy
  class; it has methods to set up and tear down little source trees with
  ``BUILD`` files.
