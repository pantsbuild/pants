Custom Pants for Your Site
==========================

*As of September 2014, this process is new and still evolving;* *expect
it to change plenty.*

You might want to tailor Pants' behavior for your organization by
defining some special functionality. If your changes are
generally-useful, you could
[[add them to Pants proper|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_contribute')]]
But perhaps your
organization has, e.g., some custom code generation that wouldn't be of
use to other organizations. You want to add some functionality to Pants
in a maintainable way.

At a high level, you want to
[[develop a Pants plugin|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_plugin')]]
and create an altered Pants that registers your Plugin in addition to
the regular ones.
