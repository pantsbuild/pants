    The service lifecycle is made up of states described in the _ServiceState class, and controlled
    by a calling thread that is holding the Service `lifecycle_lock`. Under that lock, a caller
    can signal a service to "pause", "run", or "terminate" (see _ServiceState for more details).

    pantsd pauses all Services before forking a pantsd in order to ensure that no "relevant"
    locks are held (or awaited: see #6565) by threads that might not survive the fork. While paused,
    a Service must not have any threads running that might interact with any non-private locks.

    After forking, the pantsd (child) process should call `terminate()` to finish shutting down
    the service, and the parent process should call `resume()` to cause the service to resume running.

    The state machine represents two stable states:
      Running
      Paused
    And two transitional states:
      Pausing
      Terminating

    The methods of this class allow a caller to ask the Service to transition states, and then wait
    for those transitions to occur.

    A simplifying assumption is that there is one service thread that interacts with the state, and
    only one controlling thread. In the case of `pantsd`, the "one calling thread" condition is
    protected by the service `lifecycle_lock`.

    A complicating assumption is that while a service thread is `Paused`, it must be in a position
    where it could safely disappear and never come back. This is accounted for by having the service
    thread wait on a Condition variable while Paused: testing indicates that for multiple Pythons
    on both OSX and Linux, this does not result in poisoning of the associated Lock.
