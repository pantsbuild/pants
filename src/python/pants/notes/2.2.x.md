# 2.2.x Stable Releases

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.2/docs/release-notes-2-2 for an overview of the changes in this release series.

This is the first release to require having a Python 3.7 or 3.8 interpreter to run Pants. Run `curl -L -o ./pants 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantsbuild/setup/2f079cbe4fc6a1d9d87decba51f19d7689aee69e/pants` to update your
`./pants` script to choose the correct interpreter.
