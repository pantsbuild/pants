# 2.18.x Release Series

❗❗❗ This project is no longer being released via PyPI, and is instead released via GitHub Releases. See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Overall

[The `pants` launcher binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/installation) is now required to run Pants. It must be version 0.10.0 or greater: run `PANTS_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION=report pants` to check and `SCIE_BOOT=update pants` to upgrade to the latest. Pants 2.18 and later are not distributed via PyPI, and thus the launcher is required to coordinate downloading the appropriate versions from GitHub Releases.

[The `[cli.alias]` section](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-cli) of `pants.toml` now supports defining flag-like aliases. For example: `--all-changed = "--changed-since=HEAD --changed-dependents=transitive"`.

[The `paths` goal](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-paths) now supports passing groups of targets to `--from` and/or `--to`.

The `help` goal now supports showing help for an environment variable. For example: `pants help PANTS_FIX_ONLY`.

Numerous bug fixes, including:

- The client now detects changes in pants configuration that require restarting the pants daemon.
- Sequences of goals that mutate files on disk and then immediately re-read them now no longer fail spuriously if the second goal happens faster than the OS file-change notification is received. For instance, `pants fix lint ::` would sometimes run the `lint` goal on the files before the `fix` changes were applied.
- More reliable detection of when optimised hard-linking can be used for creating sandboxes. For instance, no longer hitting errors when a single device is mounted multiple times.

The deprecation for referring to a "secondary" owner target via the file name has expired, and so this is no longer supported. For example, if `path/to/main.py` is the entry point of the `path/to:binary` `pex_binary` target, an invocation like `pants package path/to/main.py` must now use the target address instead: `pants package path/to:binary`.

### BUILD files

Several bug fixes, including:

- Better error messages when a `BUILD` file refers to an unknown value.
- `__defaults__` can now be used in the same `BUILD` file as [environment targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/environments) like `local_environment`.

### Performance

Memory usage has been reduced, particularly for the Go backend.

### Remote caching/execution

Remote caching using the gRPC remote execution API now supports mTLS, via the new [`remote_client_certs_path`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-global#remote_client_certs_path) and [`remote_client_key_path`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-global#remote_client_key_path) options in the `[GLOBAL]` section.

### Backends

Several backends that were intended to be included in previous releases were accidentally missing from the released pants artifacts, these are now available in 2.18:

- `pants.backend.experimental.openapi.codegen.java`: Enables generating Java from OpenAPI.
- `pants.backend.experimental.python.framework.django`: Enables better support for projects using Django.
- `pants.backend.experimental.swift`: Enables core Swift support.
- `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.pyenv.custom_install`: Enables customising how the pyenv provider builds a Python interpreter.

In addition, the [documentation of backends](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/enabling-backends) now lists all backends, including preview ones that were not previously advertised. Please go check it out, try backends relevant to you and let us know how they go for your use cases, [report bugs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/getting-help) and/or [submit fixes](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/contributor-overview)!

#### Docker

raw: javascript: Allow nodejs-backed tools to point to a resolve and/or package manager (#19040)

raw: javascript: Rust based dep inference for javascript (#18985)

#### Python

The functions-as-a-service (FaaS) backends, [`pants.backend.awslambda.python`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/awslambda-python) and [`pants.backend.google_cloud_function.python`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/google-cloud-function-python) have seen more improvements in 2.18:

- Deprecation: the `python_awslambda` target has been renamed to `python_aws_lambda_function`.
- Deprecation: the `[lambdex].layout = "zip"` value in `pants.toml` is now the default, and the `[lambdex]` section should be removed.
- New: [the `python_aws_lambda_layer` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/awslambda-python#building-a-lambda-layer) can be used to build Layers for AWS Lambda.
- New: the `runtime` field is no longer necessary when the interpreter constraints unambiguously refer to a single major version. For instance, with `interpreter_constraints = ["==3.11.*"]`, one doesn't need to specify `runtime="python3.11"` to `python_aws_lambda_function` or `runtime="python311"` to `python_google_cloud_function`, as it will be inferred.
- New: for AWS Lambda targets, the `complete_platforms` argument now has default values provided by Pants, which gives more reliable builds, especially when building on a different platform than the AWS Lambda itself. This change also means that only one of the `complete_platforms` or `platforms` fields should be provided.

raw: Some 2.18.0.dev0 deprecations (#19073)

raw: Remove the old Python tool lockfile functionality. (#19218)

- raw: Raise an error if isort can't read a config file (#19294)

#### Go

Memory usage has been reduced.

Go processes are now cached using the full version of the Go compiler (for example, `go1.20.6`) so that artifacts are not incorrectly reused between different patch versions.

#### JVM

The deprecation for the `excludes` field on `jvm_artifact` has expired, use `exclusions` instead.

#### Shell

The `shellcheck` binary for [the `pants.backend.shell.lint.shellcheck` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/shell#shellcheck-linter) is now fetched from `vscode-shellcheck`, and thus now supports AArch64 macOS (Apple Silicon) natively.

The deprecations for the pre-2.16 target names have expired, and thus these have been removed:

- `experimental_shell_command`: use `shell_command`
- `experimental_run_shell_command`: use `run_shell_command`

raw: Add visibility linter to report all violations. (#17671)

### Plugin API Changes

raw: Resolve pants_requirements from direct wheel links to GitHub Release assets (#19432)

raw: Support per backend requirements (#19406)

raw: Remove deprecated PythonBinary type. (#19399)

raw: Add TraverseIfNotPackageTarget deps traversal predicate for use in plugins (#19306)
