# 2.18.x Release Series

❗❗❗ This project is no longer being released via PyPI, and is instead released via GitHub Releases. See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases

## What's New

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

### BUILD files


### Overall

[The `pants` launcher binary](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/installation) is now required to run Pants. It must be version 0.10.0 or greater: run `PANTS_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION=report pants` to check and `SCIE_BOOT=update pants` to upgrade to the latest. Pants 2.18 and later are not distributed by PyPI, and thus the launcher is required to coordinate downloading the appropriate versions from GitHub Releases.

Numerous bug fixes, including:

- The client now detects changes in pants configuration that require restarting the pants daemon.
- Sequences of goals that mutate files on disk and then immediately re-read them now no longer fail spuriously if the second goal happens faster than the OS file-change notification is received. For instance,  `pants fix lint ::` would sometimes run the `lint` goal on the files before the `fix` changes were applied.
- Pants more reliably detects when optimised hard-linking can be used for creating sandboxes and so on. For instance, when a single device is mounted multiple times.


### Performance

raw: Use hardlinking when possible for mypy cache (Cherry-pick of #19633) (#19692)




### Remote caching/execution

Remote caching using the gRPC remote execution API now supports mTLS, via the new [`remote_client_certs_path`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-global#remote_client_certs_path) and [`remote_client_key_path`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/reference-global#remote_client_key_path) options in the `[GLOBAL]` section.


### Backends

#### Docker
raw: Add Docker global no build cache option (#19533)

The `shellcheck` binary for [the `pants.backend.shell.lint.shellcheck` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/shell#shellcheck-linter) is now fetched from `vscode-shellcheck`, and thus now supports AArch64 macOS (Apple Silicon) natively.

#### Visibility

[The `pants.backend.experimental.visibility` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/validating-dependencies) now works with rules about dependencies in the root of the repository.
