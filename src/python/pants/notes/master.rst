1.4.0rc0 (01/12/2018)
---------------------

The first release candidate for the ``1.4.x`` stable branch.

It's been many months since the ``1.3.x`` branch was cut: part of this was due to a decision
to tie "enabling pantsd by default" to the ``1.4.0`` release. It's taken longer to stabilize
pantsd than we initially anticipated, and while we're very nearly comfortable with enabling it
by default, we believe that we should be prioritizing frequent stable minor releases over
releases being tied to particular features. So let's do this thing!

1.3.0.dev16 (4/08/2017)
-----------------------
A weekly unstable release.

This release brings the new `pantsbuild.pants.contrib.jax_ws
<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/contrib/jax_ws>`_ plugin that can generate Java
client stubs from WSDL sources. Thanks to Chris Heisterkamp for this!

The release also pulls in a few fixes for python requirement resolution in the PEX library used by
pants. In the past, the python-setup.resolver_allow_prereleases configuration option would not
always be resepected; it now is. Additionally, a longstanding bug in transitive requirement
resolution that would lead to erroneous 'Ambiguous resolvable' errors has now been fixed. Thanks to
Todd Gardner and Nathan Butler for these fixes!

1.3.0.dev15 (4/03/2017)
-----------------------
A weekly unstable release, delayed by a week!

This release contains multiple significant new features, including the "exports" literal
on JVM targets (to better support common cases in repositories using "strict_deps"), the
initial release of the new python backend with caching support, a new "outdated.ivy" goal
to report which JVM dependencies are out of date, speedups for go builds, and last but not
least: the first release with the v2 engine enabled by default (to enable stabilization of
the pants daemon before the 1.3.x stable releases).

Thanks to the contributors!

0.0.80 (04/01/2016)
-------------------

This release brings scopes for jvm dependencies.  Proper documentation has not
been added yet, but check out the review description for more info:
https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/3582

The following deprecated items were removed:

Options:

* `--scala-platform-runtime`:
  Option is no longer used, `--version` is used to specify the major
  version. The runtime is created based on major version. The runtime
  target will be defined at the address `//:scala-library` unless it is
  overriden by the option `--runtime-spec` and a `--version` is set to
  custom.

* `--spec-excludes`:
  Use `--ignore-patterns` instead. Use .gitignore syntax for each item, to
  simulate old behavior prefix each item with "/".

* `PANTS_DEFAULT_*`:
  Use `PANTS_GLOBAL_*` instead of `PANTS_DEFAULT_*`

BUILD Files:

* `python_requirement(..., version_filter)`:
  The `version_filter` argument has been removed with no replacement.

0.0.79 (03/26/2016)
-------------------

0.0.76 (03/11/2016)
-------------------

This release features:

* The removal of the --fail-slow option to pytest.  This is now the default,
  use --fail-fast for the opposite behavior.

* Moving the Android backend into contrib.

* Support for a special append syntax for list options: +=.

* Tightening up of some aspects of option type conversion. There may be options
  in plugins that were relying on broken behavior (such as when using a string where an
  int was expected), and that will now (correctly) break.

* Deprecation of the PANTS_DEFAULT_* env vars in favor of PANTS_GLOBAL_*.

* Lots of engine work.

* A fix to task implementation versions so that bumping the task version
  will also invalidate artifacts it produced (not just invalidate .pants.d entries).

0.0.74 (02/27/2016)
-------------------

This release changes how pants detects the buildroot from using the location of a
'pants.ini' file, to using the location of a file named 'pants' (usually the name of
the pants executable script at the root of a repo). This is in service of allowing for
zero-or-more pants.ini/config files in the future.

Additionally, there is now support for validating that all options defined in a
pants.ini file are valid options. Passing or configuring '--verify-config' will trigger
this validation. To allow global options to be verified, a new [GLOBAL] section is now the
recommend place to specify global options. This differentiates them from [DEFAULT] options,
which may be used as template values in other config sections, and thus cannot be verified.

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release comes after a long and relatively quiet holiday break, but it represents a significant
milestone towards pants 1.0.0: it is no longer necessary to explicitly configure any tool versions

This release also includes beta support for scala.js via the scalajs contrib module.

Happy Holidays!

0.0.50 (9/25/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release removes the 'global' jvm compile strategy in favor of the 'isolated' strategy and
switches the default java incremental compilation frontend from jmake to zinc.  If you were using
'global' and/or jmake you'll have some pants.ini cleanup to do.  You can run the migration tool
from the `pantsbuild/pants repository <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants>`_ by cloning the repo
and running the following command from there against your own repo's pants.ini::

    pantsbuild/pants $ ./pants run migrations/options/src/python:migrate_config -- [path to your repo's pants.ini]

There have been several additional deprecated APIs removed in this release, please review the

0.0.48 (9/18/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new UI in the `./pants server` web interface that shows 'Timing Stats' graphs.  These
graphs show where time is spent on a daily-aggregation basis in various tasks.  You can drill down
into a task to see which sub-steps are most expensive.  Try it out!

We also have a few new metadata goals to help figure out what's going on with file ownership and
options.

If you want to find out where options are coming from, the `options` goal can help you out::

    $ ./pants -q options --only-overridden --scope=compile
    compile.apt.jvm_options = ['-Xmx1g', '-XX:MaxPermSize=256m'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.java.jvm_options = ['-Xmx2G'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.java.partition_size_hint = 1000000000 (from CONFIG in pants.ini)
    compile.zinc.jvm_options = ['-Xmx2g', '-XX:MaxPermSize=256m', '-Dzinc.analysis.cache.limit=0'] (from CONFIG in pants.ini)

If you're not sure which target(s) own a given file::

    $ ./pants -q list-owners -- src/python/pants/base/target.py
    src/python/pants/build_graph

The latter comes from new contributor Tansy Arron-Walker.

API Changes

0.0.47 (9/11/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By defaulting the versions of most built-in tools, this release makes pants significantly easier to configure! Tools like antlr, jmake, nailgun, etc, will use default classpaths unless override targets are provided.

Additionally, this release adds native support for shading JVM binaries, which helps to isolate them from their deployment environment.

0.0.46 (9/4/2015)
-----------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release includes more support for Node.js!

Support for the environment variables `PANTS_VERBOSE` and `PANTS_BUILD_ROOT` have been removed in
this release.  Instead, use `--level` to turn on debugging in pants.  Pants recursively searches from
the current directory to the root directory until it finds the `pants.ini` file in order to find
the build root.

The `pants()` syntax in BUILD files has been removed (deprecated since 0.0.29).

0.0.44 (8/21/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this release Go support should be considered beta.  Most features you'd expect are implemented
including a `buildgen.go` task that can maintain your Go BUILD files as inferred from just
`go_binary` target definitions.  Yet to come is `doc` goal integration and an option to wire
in-memory `buildgen.go` as an implicit bootstrap task in any pants run that includes Go targets.

Also in this release is improved control over the tools pants uses, in particular JVM selection
control.

0.0.43 (8/19/2015)
------------------

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release makes the isolated jvm compile strategy viable out-of-the-box for use with large
dependency graphs. Without it, `test.junit` and `run.jvm` performance slows down significantly
due to the large number of loose classfile directories.

Please try it out in your repo by grabbing a copy of `pants.ini.isolated
<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/pants.ini.isolated>`_ and using a command like::

    ./pants --config-override=pants.ini.isolated test examples/{src,tests}/{scala,java}/::

You'll like the results.  Just update your own `pants.ini` with the pants.ini.isolated settings to
use it by default!

In the medium term, we're interested in making the isolated strategy the default jvm compilation
strategy, so your assistance and feedback is appreciated!

Special thanks to Stu Hood and Nora Howard for lots of work over the past months to get this point.
