1.4.x Stable Releases
=====================

This document describes releases leading up to the ``1.4.x`` ``stable`` series.

1.4.0 (03/10/2018)
------------------

The ``1.4.0`` stable release, with no additional changes since the ``rc5`` release. Thanks for
your patience!

A quick summary of the changes since the ``1.3.x`` branch:

* ``pantsd`` should be usable for almost all usecases, although it is not `quite`
  ready to enable by default. Please try it out!
* There are a few new contrib plugins: ``codeanalysis`` (aka: kythe), ``thrifty``, ``avro``,
  ``mypy``, ``confluence``.
* Both pytest and junit now have support for ``--chroot`` and a ``files(..)`` target was added
  to support loose-file isolation in unit tests, and to improve the safety of test caching.
* junit also gained support for ``--no-fast``, allowing running each ``junit_test`` target in
  a separate VM.
* Beta support for ``coursier`` for artifact resolving: expected to be stable in the
  ``1.5.x`` release series.
* PEX files support bringing interpreter constraints with them to their runtime
  environment: see `PR #5160 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/5160>`_.
* Improvements to the ``missing-dep-suggest`` task that runs when ``strict_deps`` is enabled
  for a Java or Scala target.
* The ``--cache-ignore`` option was added to support forcing a rebuild of any particular
  task without requiring clean-all. Particularly helpful in these early days of test caching!
* Pants reports per-target compile and test times to its stats URL via a general
  "target-level metrics" API. Add per-target stats for your Tasks!
* ``java_thrift_library`` now takes a ``compiler_args`` property, which deprecates ``rpc_style``
  and ``language``.
* "implicit sources" are now enabled by default! If you do not specify a ``sources`` argument
  on your target, a default sources glob will be used.
  See https://www.pantsbuild.org/build_files.html for more info.

1.4.0rc0 (01/12/2018)
---------------------

The first release candidate for the ``1.4.x`` stable branch.

It's been many months since the ``1.3.x`` branch was cut: part of this was due to a decision
to tie "enabling pantsd by default" to the ``1.4.0`` release. It's taken longer to stabilize
pantsd than we initially anticipated, and while we're very nearly comfortable with enabling it
by default, we believe that we should be prioritizing frequent stable minor releases over
releases being tied to particular features. So let's do this thing!
