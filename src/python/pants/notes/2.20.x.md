# 2.20.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights

- Support for the Ruff formatter, for both `BUILD` files and normal Python files.
- The Terraform backend now has built-in support for lockfiles.

### Overall

### BUILD files

The new `pants.backend.build_files.fmt.ruff` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format `BUILD` files.

### Backends

#### Helm

The [new `lint_quiet` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/helm_chart#lint_quiet) on `helm_chart` allows passing `--quiet` to `helm lint ...`.

The `repository` field on `helm_chart` now allows trailing slashes.

The `--timeout` flag can now be passed through to `helm upgrade` operations.

#### JVM

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for third-party dependencies:

- The [new `jvm_artifacts` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifacts) supports creating `jvm_artifact` dependency targets from `pom.xml` files.
- The [new `force_version` field on `jvm_artifact`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifact#force_version) allows passing the `--force-version` flag to Coursier for particular artifacts.
- The [new `[coursier].jvm_index` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/coursier#jvm_index) allows setting the index used by Coursier.

Most codegen backends now support dependency inference, including Protobuf, SOAP, Thrift and OpenAPI.

Pants support for [IDE integration via the BSP protocol](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#working-in-an-ide) now supports Scala plugins.

The JVM documentation has been rearranged to put [Java and Scala](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala) and [Kotlin](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/kotlin) on an equal footing.

##### Scala

Plugins that cause `scalac` to emit additional compilation results (such as `semanticdb`, `scalajs` and `scalanative`) are now supported, by wrapping all results into a single `jar`.

Support for [the Scala REPL](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#repl) is now documented.

#### Python

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for Ruff:

- The new `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.format` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format Python files.
- The existing `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` linter backend has been renamed to `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check`, and its tool ID (as used by commands like `pants lint --only=...`) has changed from `ruff` to `ruff-check`.
- Pants now automatically finds Ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` files in subdirectories, for instance, `python/pyproject.toml`.
- Pants' built-in default version has been updated to 0.2.1.

#### Terraform

The Terraform backend now has [built-in support for lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/terraform#lockfiles), using the `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=path/to:module` goal, passing the address of the `terraform_module` target as the resolve.

The default built-in version of Terraform has been upgraded from 1.4.6 to 1.7.1. Pants now has [built-in knowledge of versions up to 1.7.1](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#known_versions), so the version can be overridden by setting [`[download-terraform].version`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#version) explicitly.
