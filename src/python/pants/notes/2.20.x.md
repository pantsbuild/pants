# 2.20.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights

- Support for the Ruff formatter, for both `BUILD` files and normal Python files.
- The Terraform backend now has built-in support for lockfiles.

### Overall

The dependency goals now support JSON output using the `--format` option for easier [introspection of the dependency graph](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/project-introspection#export-dependency-graph). For instance, [`pants dependencies --format=json ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/dependencies#format) and [`pants dependents --format=json ...`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/goals/dependents#format).

The [new `[stats].output_file` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/stats#output_file) allows appending the stats output to a file, rather than printing it on stdout. This allows hiding this output on CI, while still ensuring it's available when required.

[The `[GLOBAL].pants_ignore` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#pants_ignore) no longer ignores `.github` by default, so files within that directory will now be visible to Pants automatically.

Using [the `--changed-...` options](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/changed) to only run on files that have been edited now no longer emits spurious warnings if files have been deleted.

We've made many changes to documentation, including:

- How to use [the `.pants.bootstrap` file](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options#pantsbootstrap-file) for running commands before start-up or setting default environment variables or similar.
- How to use [the `[cli].alias` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/advanced-target-selection#using-cli-aliases) for abbreviating common pants invocations.
- How to use [the `target` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files#using-the-generic-target) to abbreviate common `dependencies=["..."]` parameters.
- An improved version of [the nuking script](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/using-pants-in-ci#directories-to-cache) when doing coarse-grained caching in CI, like GitHub Actions.
- Several pages have been renamed or moved: existing links to 2.19 and earlier will still work, but their locations in 2.20 may have changed.

### BUILD files

The new `pants.backend.build_files.fmt.ruff` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format `BUILD` files.

### Remote caching/execution

Pants now has experimental support for additional remote cache providers beyond the GRPC Remote Execution API. Set [the `[GLOBAL].remote_provider` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_provider), to be able to use:

- [the GitHub Actions Cache](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/remote-caching#github-actions-cache)
- [a local directory](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/remote-caching#local-file-system)

In support of this, [the `[GLOBAL].remote_oauth_bearer_token` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_oauth_bearer_token) has been added to set the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. [The `[GLOBAL].remote_oauth_bearer_token_path` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_oauth_bearer_token_path) has been deprecated in favour of using the new option with [a file reference](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options#reading-individual-option-values-from-files): `remote_oauth_bearer_token = "@/path/to/file.txt"`.

[The `[GLOBAL].remote_cache_warnings` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/global-options#remote_cache_warnings) now supports `always`.

### Backends

#### Docker

The [new `{full_directory}` interpolation](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/docker/tagging-docker-images#setting-a-repository-name) in `repository` and `default_repository` options expands to the full path to the `BUILD` file that contains a `docker_image` target.

The new `pants.backend.experimental.docker.podman` backend allows using [Podman](https://podman.io). Add that backend to `backend_packages` and the Docker backend will invoke Podman instead of Docker. [The new option `[docker].experimental_enable_podman`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/docker#experimental_enable_podman) allows disabling this once the backend is loaded.

Dependency inference now works for parameterized targets, like `ARG base="path/to:target@param=value"`.

Pants is now able to extract the image ID when building a docker image with a daemon using the containerd-snapshotter feature.

The default version of Hadolint has been updated from 2.10.0 to 2.12.1-beta.

#### Helm

The [new `lint_quiet` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/helm_chart#lint_quiet) on `helm_chart` allows passing `--quiet` to `helm lint ...`.

The `repository` field on `helm_chart` now allows trailing slashes.

The `--timeout` flag can now be passed through to `helm upgrade` operations.

#### JavaScript

The [`pants.backend.experimental.javascript` experimental backend](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-javascript) has had a few bug-fixes:

- [`package_json` targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/package_json) that use `yarn` now support running `node_build_scripts`.
- Dependencies are inferred from `export ... from ...` statements, similar to `import ... from ...`.

#### JVM

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for third-party dependencies:

- The [new `jvm_artifacts` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifacts) supports creating `jvm_artifact` dependency targets from `pom.xml` files.
- The [new `force_version` field on `jvm_artifact`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifact#force_version) allows passing the `--force-version` flag to Coursier for particular artifacts.
- The [new `[coursier].jvm_index` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/coursier#jvm_index) allows setting the index used by Coursier.

Most codegen backends now support dependency inference, including Protobuf, SOAP, Thrift and OpenAPI.

Pants support for [IDE integration via the BSP protocol](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#working-in-an-ide) now supports Scala plugins.

The JVM documentation has been rearranged to put [Java and Scala](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala) and [Kotlin](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/kotlin) on an equal footing.

##### Scala

Plugins that cause `scalac` to emit additional compilation results (such as `semanticdb`, `scalajs` and `scalanative`) are now supported, by wrapping all results into a single `jar`.

Support for [the Scala REPL](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#repl) is now documented.

#### Python

Several improvements have been made to Pants' support for Ruff:

- The new `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.format` backend allows using [the Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to format Python files.
- The existing `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` linter backend has been renamed to `pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff.check`, and its tool ID (as used by commands like `pants lint --only=...`) has changed from `ruff` to `ruff-check`.
- Pants now automatically finds Ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` files in subdirectories, for instance, `python/pyproject.toml`.
- Pants' built-in default version has been updated to 0.2.1.

#### Terraform

The Terraform backend now has [built-in support for lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/terraform#lockfiles), using the `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=path/to:module` goal, passing the address of the `terraform_module` target as the resolve.

The default built-in version of Terraform has been upgraded from 1.4.6 to 1.7.1. Pants now has [built-in knowledge of versions up to 1.7.1](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#known_versions), so the version can be overridden by setting [`[download-terraform].version`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/download-terraform#version) explicitly.


#### NEW: TypeScript

The `pants.backend.experimental.typescript` experimental backend now exists with support for tailoring [`typescript_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/typescript_sources) and [`typescript_tests`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/typescript_tests) targets. Note: [dependency inference](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/20293) and other built-in functionality is not yet implemented.
