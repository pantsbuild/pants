1.3.0 (06/06/2017)
------------------

The ``1.3.0`` stable release, with no addition changes since the rc4 release!

A quick summary of exciting changes since the ``1.2.x`` branch:

* Pants' python backend has been overhauled and modernized to support caching, and to lower the
  latency of re-running tests after a code edit.
* Pants now uses a `native code 'engine' <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C64MreDeVoZAl3HrqtWUVE-qnj3MyWW0NQ52xejjaWw/edit?usp=sharing>`_
  implemented in rust, which unlocks significant performance improvements in the future.
* A daemon that caches BUILD file parsing and file fingerprinting (and more to follow!) is now `ready
  for alpha testing <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/b5eaf05ef533df4c5f93a3728107a27f25726941/pants.daemon.ini>`_
  (with `two significant caveats <http://www.pantsbuild.org/invoking.html#the-pants-daemon>`_).
* A default set of `implicit_sources <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/4300>`_ can now be
  manually enabled to further reduce BUILD file boilerplate. This option should become the
  default in the next stable release.
* The Zinc incremental scala compiler is now at 1.0.0, with improved incremental behaviour.
* Style-related tasks that used to be in the `compile` goal have moved to a new `lint` goal.
* The `fmt` goal was added, with support for scalafmt, `gofmt`, and python `isort` to start.
* `Support for yarnpkg <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4255>`_ in the node contrib module.
* Support for `relative 'jar' declarations <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4279>`_, to
  allow for committing jars in your repo (if that's your bag!)
* A contrib module for `errorprone <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4163>`_ was added.
* Direct support for `scalatest` tests in the pants JVM test runner.

1.3.0.dev16 (4/08/2017)
-----------------------
A weekly unstable release.

This release brings the new `pantsbuild.pants.contrib.jax_ws
<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/contrib/jax_ws>`_ plugin that can generate Java
client stubs from WSDL sources. Thanks to Chris Heisterkamp for this!

The release also pulls in a few fixes for python requirement resolution in the PEX library used by
pants. In the past, the python-setup.resolver_allow_prereleases configuration option would not
always be resepected; it now is. Additionally, a longstanding bug in transitive requirement
resolution that would lead to erroneous 'Ambiguous resolvable' errors has now been fixed. Thanks to
Todd Gardner and Nathan Butler for these fixes!

least: the first release with the v2 engine enabled by default (to enable stabilization of
the pants daemon before the 1.3.x stable releases).
