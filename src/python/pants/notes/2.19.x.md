# 2.19.x Release Series

Pants 2 is a fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes. It's currently focused on Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker, with support for other languages and frameworks coming soon.

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

## What's New

### Highlights

### Overall

### BUILD files

### Performance

### Remote caching/execution

Large files that need to be stored to a remote cache are now streamed to it directly from disk, in a way that should reduce overhead and increase concurrency ([#19711](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/19711)).

### Backends

#### Docker

The [docker backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/docker) now has explicit support for using [`buildx` (and thus BuildKit)](https://github.com/docker/buildx#buildx), via [the new `use_buildx` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/reference-docker#use_buildx). This also allows adding few additional fields for [`docker_image` targets](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/reference-docker_image), for `buildx`-specific functionality:

- [`cache_from` and `cache_to`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/docker#external-cache-storage-backends) for using external cache storage backends
- [`output`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/reference-docker_image#codeoutputcode) to control how/where `buildx` outputs an image when running `pants package ::`
