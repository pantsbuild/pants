# 2.17.x Release Series

❗❗❗ This project is no longer being released via PyPI, and is instead released via GitHub Releases. See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases

## What's New

Individuals and companies can now [sponsor Pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship).

Pants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. These expenses are managed by Pants Build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. This non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use Pants.

We offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).

### Overall

The [`pants` launcher binary](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants) (aka `scie-pants`) is now the recommended way to run Pants.
Use of a `./pants` shell script in a repository is deprecated.

The `pants` launcher has numerous benefits, such as:

* automatically download and maintain a Python distribution for running Pants
* run `pants` from any directory within a repository and not just the build root
* far less overhead when starting commands (up to 4-5×)

See the [Pants  installation
instructions](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/installation) for additional information on how to migrate to the `pants` launcher binary.

Related to this, pants' distribution model is changing, and 2.17 will be the last version where:

* the `pantsbuild.pants` package is published to PyPI. Use [the `pants_requirements` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/reference-pants_requirements) for installing the requisite packages for plugins, rather than `python_requirement` or similar.
* the universal (cross-platform) `pants` PEX is published to GitHub Releases. For future releases, smaller per-platform PEXes will be attached instead.

### Performance

As mentioned above, the new launcher binary reduces start-up overhead.

Large files are now cached as standalone files on disk, rather than stored directly in the internal database pants uses for cache (but still under the `~/.cache/pants/lmdb_store` directory). This improves performance for manipulating these files, especially when the cache directory and sandbox temporary directory are on the same file system and thus allow hard-linking.

### Backends

#### Python

Python dependencies are now analyzed via an intrinsic rule implemented in Rust for increased performance
over the prior Python implementation of the rule. See [#18854](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/18854) for
discusion of the performance improvements.

Exported mutable virtualenvs can now include [PEP-660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) editable installs of `python_distribution` targets.
To enable this feature for a resolve, add that resolve's name to the `[export].py_editables_in_resolves` list in `pants.toml`.
See [#18639](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/18639) for details on Pants' PEP-660 implementation.

The default `pip` Pants uses under the hood has changed from 20.3.4 to 23.1.2. This newer `pip` has better dependency resolution performance in many cases, but may give different results than the earlier `pip`. Of course those results will still be correct in the sense that they will be compatible with your requirements and constraints.

The `python_awslambda` or `python_google_cloud_function` targets now support a new 'zip' layout, as recommended by the cloud vendors. This layout gives smaller packages and faster cold starts than the existing Lambdex layout, and will become the default in 2.18. See the docs [for `python_awslambda`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/awslambda-python#migrating-from-pants-216-and-earlier) and [for `python_google_cloud_function`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/google-cloud-function-python#migrating-from-pants-216-and-earlier).

The default value for the `[python].interpreter_constraints` option was deprecated in 2.16 and is now removed: `pants.toml` must provide this option. We recommend constraining to a single interpreter minor version if you can, for instance: `interpreter_constraints = ['==3.11.*']`. See [the Interpreter Compatibility docs for more details](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-interpreter-compatibility).

#### Docker

The Docker backend now supports authenticating with registries via the `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_CONFIG` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variables.

#### New: Javascript (experimental!)

Pants now has _very early_ experimental support for Javascript thanks to ongoing efforts by Tobias Nilsson and
Theo Ribeiro. Please note that the Javascript backend is still incomplete, is being actively developed, and _probably
has critical bugs_. Despite that, the Pants maintainers would appreciate any feedback from the community to help
guide our development efforts.

Supported goals are:

* `test`: Letting you run tests via runners installed with the package manager of your choice.
* `package` goal, either to run a customized `package.json` script that produces an artifact via `node_build_script`, or to pack a tarball for npm-registry publication via the `npm_distribution` target.
* `tailor`: Generates build file targets for `*.js`, `*.test.js` and `package.json` files.
* `generate-lockfile`: Creates the lockfile in the format matching a projects package manager.

The backend supports all package managers provided by `corepack`. `yarn@v2` and [PlugNPlay](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) is not supported.

Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.javascript` backend to try out this support. Please [file issues](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) for any issues encountered, and follow along [the stabilization ticket on github](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/19240).

#### New: Taplo TOML Formatter

Pants now supports the [Taplo TOML formatter](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/). Enable the `pants.backend.tools.taplo`
backend to add this support.

### Plugin API Changes

Rules should now request output types which do not need an input type via the new one-argument form of `Get`. For
example, rules can now write `await Get(ChosenLocalEnvironmentName)`. Certain request types which exists only to
work around the previous lack of such synax are now deprecated in favor of the one argument `Get()` form.

The `PythonBinary` type is now deprecated, use `PythonBuildStandalone` instead.
