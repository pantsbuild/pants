# 2.16.x Release Series

## What's New

### BUILD files

The new `env` function in BUILD files allows access to environment variables in BUILD files.

Run `pants help symbols` for documentation of all builtin symbols and macros provided by prelude files
which are usable in BUILD files.

The visibility rules syntax now supports matching on target names. The rules glob syntax also now uses
the same syntax as target selectors.

### Backends

#### Docker

The [`{pants.hash}`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/tagging-docker-images#string-interpolation-using-placeholder-values)
generation code was changed such that the generated hash for the same input will be different in pants 2.16.

#### Python

The Python backend added or improved support for various tools including:

- [`pydocstyle`](https://www.pydocstyle.org/) is now supported for linting Python doc strings. Enable the
`pants.backend.python.lint.pydocstyle` backend to add this support.

- [`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) is now supported for linting and formatting Python code. Enable the
`pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` backend to add this support.

- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is now supported as a way for Pants to provide a hermetic version of Python
for each relevant Interpreter required to run user code. Enable the `pants.backend.python.providers.experimental.pyenv`
backend to add this support.

- Pants now understands how to parse dependencies of projects using the OpenStack/Stevedore ((https://github.com/openstack/stevedore)
project. Enable the `pants.backend.python.framework.stevedore` backend to add this support.

- More Python target types now have the `environment` field and thus can execute in non-local environments.

Deprecations:

- The default value of `CPython>=3.7,<4` for the `[python].interpreter_constraints` option is now
deprecated and will be removed in Pants v2.17.x.  This options sets Python interpreter
constraints for Python-related targets which did not otherwise specify their own interpreter
constraints. Instead of relying on this default, explicitly set the
`[python].interpreter_constraints` option appropriately. We recommend constraining to a single
interpreter minor version if you can, e.g., `interpreter_constraints = ['==3.11.*']`, or at least
a small number of interpreter minor versions, e.g., `interpreter_constraints = ['>=3.10,<3.12']`.

- The special Python "tool lockfile" functionality is deprecated. Repos can now use regular "user lockfiles" to provide custom versions of tools.

#### Shell command improvements and support for ad-hoc tools

The Shell backend along with the new `pants.backend.experimental.adhoc` backend have received a number of improvements so that
Pants is able to invoke workflows that include tools for which Pants does not yet have a
dedicated backend.

In recognition of these improvements, the `experimental_shell_command` and `experimental_run_shell_command` target
types have graduated to no longer have the `experimental_` prefix; use `shell_command` and `run_shell_command`
respectively instead.

The improvements include:

- The `shell_command` continues to provide a way to run a tool for its side effects and capture
outputs from the tool invocation for consumption as dependencies by other target types, but has had several improvements:

  - the `dependencies` field has been deprecated, and separated into three fields: `execution_dependencies` for
    dependencies required to execute the command, `output_dependencies` for dependencies required to
    use the output, and `runnable_dependencies` for targets that need to exist as directly
    executable on the sandbox's `PATH`
  - the `outputs` field has been separated into `output_files` and `output_directories`
  - the directory in which the command is invoked can be controlled via the new `workdir` field
  - the location of the output files when consumed as a dependency can be controlled via the new `root_output_directory` field

- Preserving symlinks as symlinks in process output, rather than resolving them to their target
file. This eliminates the need for work-arounds in `shell_command`s that happen to generate
semantically-relevant symlinks, such as the contents of `node_modules/.bin` if using `shell_command`
to invoke `npm ci` or `npm install`.

- The new `adhoc_tool` target type supplied by the `adhoc` backend allows executing most "runnable" target types (those supported for `pants run` goal) exported by another Pants backend in an execution sandbox goal, allowing you to capture their outputs to be captured. The outputs can then be consumed by another Pants target in a similar manner to the `shell_command` target type.
"Runnable" target types include:
  * Adhoc: `system_binary`
  * Docker: `docker_image`
  * Go: `go_binary`
  * JVM: `jvm_artifact`, and `deploy_jar`
  * Python: `pex_binary`, `python_requirement`, `python_source`, and `pyoxidizer_binary`

- The new `system_binary` target type supplied by the `adhoc` backend wraps any externally-managed tool so that the 
tool may be invoked as a "runnable" by the `adhoc_tool` target type, while also allowing tool versions to be pinned for reproducibility.

- Support for running in non-local environments as specified by the `environment` field on `shell_command`, `adhoc_tool`, and related target types.

- Defining arbitrary shell commands as tests which can be invoked using `pants test` via the
new `experimental_test_shell_command` target type.

- The `workdir` field to `run_shell_command` has been switched to match the documented behavior: it now runs from the same directory as the `BUILD` file by default. To preserve the old behavior, explicitly set `workdir="/"`. The stabilisation also fixes other bugs with relative paths passed to the `workdir` field and thus may require updates.

Ad-hoc tool support, with the `adhoc_tool` or `shell_command` targets, can be used to compile third party
libraries in unsupported languages, run tools from ecosystems Pants doesn't yet directly support, and other similar code-generation tasks. 
These targets can be used for first-party code generation, making use of existing backends that define
"runnable" targets if needed. For instance, exporting a OpenAPI schema from a Python API server, letting Pants
manage the interpreters and dependencies required.

Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.adhoc` backend to add the features supplied by the `adhoc` backend.
Enable the `pants.backend.shell` backend for the shell-related functionality including `shell_command` and
`run_shell_command` target types.

#### Go

The Go backend has received a large number of changes in order to be ready for Go v1.20
and to make continued progress on [stabilizing the Go backend](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/17447).

The main change is that Pants will now compile Go SDK packages from scratch and no longer rely on
the prebuilt package archives distributed with the Go SDK. Go v1.20 will no longer ship with those
prebuilt package archives, and so this change was necessary for Pants to continue to work 
with Go v1.20 and later releases. (It is also a correctness issue since Pants will now be able to
apply compiler options consistently to both first-party Go code and Go SDK packages.)

The Pants team would appreciate if the community could try out 2.16.x with your Go code as an additional
check to ensure there are no regressions.

The Go backend also now supports:
- Environments are supported via the `environment` field available now on `go_binary` targets.
- Code coverage can now analyze coverage for packages beyond just the package under test via the new
`--go-test-cover-packages` option.
- Numerous bug fixes to the Cgo support.
- The [data race detector](https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector) is supported via the `race` field now available on `go_binary` targets.
- Compiler and other flags may be set via the `compiler_flags`, `linker_flags`, and `assembler_flags` fields
available on various target types.

#### Buf

Pants is now able to discover and supply configuration files for the `Buf` protobuf linter.

#### New: Preamble

The new "preamble" plugin allows formatting/linting files to ensure they start with specific text, such as a copyright header. Enable the
`pants.backend.tools.preamble` backend to add this support.

#### New: CUE

Pants now have basic support for the [CUE language](https://cuelang.org/) for defining, generating, and validating configuration data.
Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.cue` backend to use this support.

#### New: YamlLint

Pants now the supports the [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io) linter for YAML files. Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.tools.yamllint` backend to add this support.

#### New: AWS S3 support for URLs

Pants now supports referencing S3 URLs via the scheme (E.g. `s3://`), or authority (E.g. `*.s3*amazonaws.com` or `s3.*amazonaws.com`)
anywhere a URL can be specified.
Credentials are loaded similar to the AWS CLI (most regularly `~/.aws/credentials`) and attached as headers in the request (which aren't cached or logged).

Enable the `pants.backend.url_handlers.s3` backend to add this support.

#### New

### Plugin API Changes

The `URLDownloadHandler` union has been added to allow plugins to modify native URL downloading, such as transforming the URL or attaching headers for auth.

The `frozen_after_init` decorator on dataclasses has been removed from many parts of the Pants codebase. Plugin authors should avoid use of this decorator because it will likely be removed in a future Pants version.

The deprecated `Platform.current` has been removed. Instead, have the affected rules take a `Platform` directly as a parameter and the engine will supply the relevant `Platform` instance.

The `ToolCustomLockfile` and `ToolDefaultLockfile` classes [have been removed](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/17843).
