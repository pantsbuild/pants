# 2.16.x Release Series

## What's New

### BUILD files

The new `env` function in BUILD files allows access to environment variables in BUILD files.

### Backends

#### Python

The Python backend has two new linters:

[`pydocstyle`](https://www.pydocstyle.org/) is now supported for linting Python doc strings. Enable the
`pants.backend.python.lint.pydocstyle` backend to add this support.

[`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) is now supported for linting and formatting Python code. Enable the
`pants.backend.experimental.python.lint.ruff` backend to add this support.

#### Go

The Go backend has received a large number of changes in order to be ready for Go v1.20
and to make continued progress on [stabilizing the Go backend](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/17447).

The main change is that Pants will now compile Go SDK packages from scratch and no longer rely on
the prebuilt package archives distributed with the Go SDK. Go v1.20 will no longer ship with those
prebuilt package archives, and so this change was necessary for Pants to continue to work 
with Go v1.20 and later releases. (It is also a correctness issue since Pants will now be able to
apply compiler options consistently when building Go SDK packages.)

The Pants team would appreciate if the community could try out 2.16.x with your Go code as an additional
check to ensure there are no regressions.

The Go backend also now supports:
- Environments are supported via the `environment` field available now on `go_binary` targets.
- Code coverage can now analyze coverage for packages beyond just the package under test via the new
`--go-test-cover-packages` option.
- Numerous bug fixes to the Cgo support.
- Race detector is supported via the `race` field now available on `go_binary` targets.
- Compiler and other flags may be set via the `compiler_flags`, `linker_flags`, and `assembler_flags` fields
available on various target types.

#### Shell

A new `experimental_test_shell_command` target type has been added to allow defining arbitrary shell commands
as tests which can be invoked using the `./pants test` goal.

`shell_command` now supports the `environment` field for running in non-local environments.

#### New: Preamble

The new "preamble" plugin allows linting files to ensure they start with specific text. Enable the
`pants.backend.tools.preamble` backend to add this support.

#### New: CUE

Pants now supports the [CUE language](https://cuelang.org/) for defining, generating, and validating configuration data.
Enable the `pants.backend.experimental.cue` backend to add this support.
