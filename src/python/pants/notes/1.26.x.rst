1.26.x Stable Releases
======================

This document describes releases leading up to the ``1.26.x`` ``stable`` series.

Some significant changes in this series:

* Pants now uses PEX ``2.1.x``, which uses PIP under the hood, and consequently significantly changes resolves (in order to better align with the wider Python ecosystem). Please see https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/788 for details.

* Adds support for TOML config files, e.g. ``pants.toml``. INI config files will still be supported for some time, but INI is now legacy. Please see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pants-devel/N1H03oJONco for more information.

1.26.1rc0 (6/16/2020)
---------------------

N.B.: No further releases are expected in the ``1.26.x`` ``stable`` series. This ``.1rc0``
release is for those upgrading through stable versions who wish to retain pytest console
coverage support in Pants "v1".

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

  `PR #10017 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/10017>`_

1.26.0 (04/29/2020)
