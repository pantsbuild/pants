We use these thrift files to test the 'namespace packages' functionality
in python_thrift_library:

Python does not normally allow the contents of a package to be retrieved from
more than one location. If two modules on the pythonpath share some package
prefix (in our case two python_thrift_library eggs containing two different
modules under 'twitter.birds') then python will only consider the first location
at which it finds that package prefix. Namespace packages solve this by adding
some magic words to the __init__.py files in the intermediate modules.

TODO: Stop supporting this? namespace packages are not endorsed by the python community.
