Pants Contributors Guide
========================

This page documents how to make contributions to Pants. If you've
[[developed a change to Pants|pants('src/docs:howto_develop')]],
it passes all tests, and
you'd like to "send it upstream", here's what to do:

Life of a Change
----------------

Let's walk through the process of making a change to pants. At a high
level, the steps are:

-   Identify the change you'd like to make (e.g.: fix a bug, add a feature).
-   Get the code.
-   Make your change on a branch.
-   Get a code review.
-   Commit your change to master.

### Identify the change

It's a good idea to make sure the work you'll be embarking on is
generally agreed to be in a useful direction for the project before
getting too far along.

If there is a pre-existing github issue filed and un-assigned, feel free
to grab it and ask any clarifying questions needed on
[pants-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pants-devel). If
there is an issue you'd like to work on that's assigned and stagnant,
please ping the assignee and finally
[pants-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pants-devel)
before taking over ownership for the issue.

If you have an idea for new work that's not yet been discussed on
[pants-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pants-devel), then
start a conversation there to vet the proposal. Once the group agrees
it's worth a spike you can file a github issue and assign it to
yourself.

### Getting Pants Source Code

If you just want to compile and look at the source code, the easiest way
is to clone the repo.

    :::bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants

If you would like to start developing patches and contributing them
back, you will want to create a fork of the repo using the [instructions
on github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). With this
setup, you can push branches and run Travis-CI before your change is
committed.

If you've already cloned your repo without forking, you don't have to
re-checkout your repo. First, create the fork on github. Make a note the
clone url of your fork. Then run the following commands:

    :::bash
    $ git remote remove origin
    $ git remote add origin <url-to-clone-your-fork>
    $ git remote add upstream  https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants

After this change, `git push` and `git pull` will go to your fork. You
can get the latest changes from the `pantsbuild/pants` repo's master
branch using the [syncing a
fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) instructions on
github.

Whether you've cloned the repo or your fork of the repo, you should setup the
local pre-commit hooks to ensure your commits meet minimum compliance checks
before pushing branches to ci:

    :::bash
    $ ./build-support/bin/setup.sh

You can always run the pre-commit checks manually via:

    :::bash
    $ ./build-support/bin/pre-commit.sh

**Pro tip:** If you are certain that you have not accidentally committed anything to
the `master` branch that you want to keep, and you want to reset to an _exact_ copy of
the `pantsbuild/pants` repo's master branch, use these commands:

    :::bash
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout master && git reset --hard upstream/master

**Mac users:** Pants requires a more modern OpenSSL version than the one that comes with macOS.
To get all dependencies to resolve correctly, run the following commands the first time you
set up Pants.

    :::bash
    $ brew install openssl
    $ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"' >> ~/.bashrc

### Making the Change

You might want to familiarize yourself with the
[[Pants Internals|pants('src/docs:internals')]],
[[Pants Developers Guide|pants('src/docs:howto_develop')]], and the
[[Pants Style Guide|pants('src/docs:styleguide')]].

Create a new branch off master and make changes.

    :::bash
    $ git checkout -b $FEATURE_BRANCH

Does your change alter Pants' behavior in a way users will notice? If
so, then along with changing code...

+   Consider updating the
    [[user documentation|pants('src/docs:docs')]].

### Run the CI Tests

Before posting a review but certainly before the branch ships you should
run relevant tests. If you're not sure what those are,
<a pantsref="dev_run_all_tests">run all the tests</a>.

### Code Review

Now that your change is complete, post it for review. We use `github.com` pull requests
to host code reviews:

#### Posting the First Draft

When <a pantsref="dev_run_all_tests">all of the tests are green on travis</a>, you're
probably ready to request review for the change!

To get your pull request reviewed, you should:

- Include a short and descriptive title.
- Fill in each of the sections of the pull request template, and include links to any
  relevant github issues for the change.
- Mention (usually in a comment on the PR) any specific
  [pants committers](https://github.com/orgs/pantsbuild/teams/committers)
  who should review your change. Running `git log -- $filename` on one or more of the files that
  you changed is a good way to find potential reviewers!

You can see a list of all actively `reviewable` reviews [here](
https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aopen%20status%3Asuccess).

#### Iterating

If reviewers post any feedback
([for more information on providing feedback see](
https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request/)),
there might be a few iterations before finally getting a Ship It. As reviewers enter
feedback, the github page updates; it should also send
you mail as long as you are `Subscribed` to notifications for the pull request.

Github pull requests currently lack the ability to mark a review comment as "blocking"
for a change, so it's important for contributors and reviewers to communicate clearly which
comments they view as blocking. If it's unclear whether a reviewer feels strongly about
a particular point, please bias toward clearing up the uncertainty before proceeding.

If those reviews inspire you to change some code, great.  Change some
code and commit locally. When you're ready to update the pull request with your changes,
push to the relevant branch on your fork as you did before:

    :::bash
    $ git push <your-username> $FEATURE_BRANCH

Look over the fields in the pull request you created earlier; perhaps some could use updating.
Press the web form's `edit` button.

If at any point you need to make changes that will fundamentally overhaul a review,
consider temporarily removing the `reviewable` label in order to let reviewers know
to hold off until the code is ready.

#### CI Failing?

If your pull request fails in travis, you can look at the shard logs to see the
failure cause. From that log, you can figure out what tests you need to run to reproduce the failure
locally. If you cannot reproduce the failure locally and it looks unrelated to your change, please
open an issue for it with the label
[`flaky-test`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/labels/flaky-test). You can also ping slack to
ask for someone to restart the failing shard.

### Committing a Change

At this point you've made a change, had it reviewed (and received one or more Ship Its!) and
are ready to complete things by getting your change in master. (If you're not a
committer, please ask one to do this section for you.)

A committer should push the `Squash and merge` button on the PR, and ensure that the
commit message generated from the review summary is accurate. In particular, the title should
contain a useful summary of the change, and the description should follow the pull request
template (defined in the root of the repo at `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).

Finally, the committer will select `Confirm squash and merge`. The change is now complete. Huzzah!
