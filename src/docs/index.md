Pants is a build system designed for codebases that:

+ Are large and/or growing rapidly.
+ Consist of many subprojects that share a significant amount of code.
+ Have complex dependencies on third-party libraries.
+ Use a variety of languages, code generators and frameworks.

<br/>

Pants supports Java, Scala, Python, C/C++, Go, Javascript/Node, Thrift, Protobuf and Android code.
Adding support for other languages, frameworks and code generators is straightforward.
