Testimonials
------------

> "Scala compilation is notoriously slow, making build times prohibitively long at scale. Pants'
> fine-grained dependency management and robust shared build cache helped us shrink build times and
> increase productivity despite the fast growth of our codebase. Its modularity and extensibility
> made it easy for us to add custom build steps, such as code generation, and to reason
> programmatically about dependencies. Pants has proven to be a core part of a powerful toolchain
> that has scaled up well with our codebase." -- Benjy Weinberger, Foursquare


> "At Square, we have a large git repo with hundreds of projects.  We build and ship
> from a master branch that gets hundreds of commits daily.  Pants gives our developers
> a faster and more reliable incremental build experience than Maven in this environment.
>
> One particular problem our users faced was integrating with IntelliJ.   Previously,
> developers were stuck waiting long times for Maven to refresh the IDE configuration, or had
> to install binary versions of projects which quickly go out of date.   Both the pants
> plugin for IntelliJ and the idea goal make it easy for users to switch between git branches
> and different projects within the repo freely  without worrying about taking a productivity
> hit to reconfigure their IDE."  -- Eric Ayers, Square

> "I'm super happy with pants, it's now powering almost all our java, scala and python builds,
> along with a few go and node projects" -- Arni Hermann, QuizUp
