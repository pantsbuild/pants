Publishing Artifacts
====================

A library owner/maintainer can *publish* versioned artifacts that folks
elsewhere can fetch and import. In the JVM world, these are jars (with
poms) on a server that Maven (or Ivy) looks for. (In the Python world,
these are eggs; but as of early 2014, Pants doesn't help publish these.)

This page talks about publishing artifacts. We assume you already know
enough about Pants to *build* the library that underlies an artifact. To
*use* an artifact that has already been published from some other source
tree, see
[[Third-Party Dependencies|pants('src/docs:3rdparty')]].
(To use a artifact that has been published from
*your own* source tree... don't do that. Instead, depend on the
`*_library` build target.)

It's tricky to keep track of versions, label artifacts with versions,
and upload those artifacts. Pants eases these tasks.

A library's build target specifies where to publish it. For example, a
<a pantsref="bdict_java_library">`java_library`</a>
build target can have a `provides` parameter of type
<a pantsref="bdict_artifact">`artifact`</a>.
The `artifact` specifies an "address" similar to
what you might see in `3rdparty` `BUILD` files: an artifact's location.
It does *not* specify a version; that changes each time you publish.
For an example, see
[examples/src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/greet/BUILD](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/examples/src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/greet/BUILD):

!inc[start-at=java_library](../../examples/src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/greet/BUILD)

(That `repo=` parameter assumes someone has set up your Pants configuration to know about that
artifact repository. If that assumption is false, keep reading to find out how to set this up.)

Pants' `publish` goal builds the library, bumps the library's version
number, and uploads the library to its repository. Actually, it does
quite a bit more than that.

It uses [Semantic Versioning ("semver")](http://semver.org/) for
versioning. Versions are dotted number triads (e.g., 2.5.6); when Pants
bumps a version, it specifically bumps the patch number part. Thus, if
the current version is 2.5.6, Pants bumps to 2.5.7. To publish a minor
or major version instead of a patch, you override the version number on
the command line.

**The pushdb:** To "remember" version numbers, Pants uses the pushdb.
The pushdb is a text file under source control. It lists artifacts with
their current version numbers and SHAs. When you publish artifacts,
pants edits this file and pushes it to the origin.

Life of a Publish
-----------------

To publish a library's artifact, Pants bumps the version number and
uploads the artifact to a repository. When things go smoothly, that's
all you need to know. When things go wrong, it's good to know details.

-   Pants decides the version number to use based on pushdb's state.

    You can override the version number[s] to use via a command-line
    flag. Pants does some sanity-checking: If you specify an override
    version less than or equal to the last-published version (as noted
    in the pushdb), Pants balks.

-   For each artifact to be published, it prompts you for confirmation.
    (This is a chance for you to notice that you want to, e.g., bump an
    artifact's minor revision instead of patch revision.)

-   Invokes a tool to upload the artifact to a repository. (For JVM
    artifacts, this tool is Ivy.)

-   Commits pushdb.

Things can go wrong; you can recover:

-   Uploading the artifact can fail for reasons you might expect for an
    upload: authentication problems, transient connection problems, etc.
-   Uploading the artifact can fail for another reason: that
    artifact+version already exists on the server. *In theory*, this
    shouldn't happen: Pants bumps the version it found in the pushdb.
    But in practice, this can happen.

        Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: destination file exists and overwrite == false
        ...
        FAILURE: java -jar .../ivy/lib/ivy-2.2.0.jar ... exited non-zero (1) 'failed to push com.twitter#archimedes_common;0.0.42'

    This is usually a sign that something strange happened in a
    *previous* publish. Perhaps someone published an artifact "by hand"
    instead of using Pants. Perhaps someone used Pants to publish an
    artifact but it failed to update the pushdb in source control. E.g.,
    merge conflicts can happen, and folks don't always recover from them
    correctly.

    In this situation, you probably want to pass `publish --overrride=<version>` to specify a
    version to use instead of the automatically-computed already-existing version. Choose a version
    that's not already on the server. Pants records this version in the pushdb, so hopefully the
    next publisher won't have the same problem.

    Perhaps you are "racing" a colleague and just lost the race: they
    published an artifact with that name+version.

    In this situation, you probably want to refresh your source tree
    (`git pull` or equivalent) to get the latest version of the pushdb
    and try again.

-   Pushing the pushdb to origin can fail, even though
    artifact-uploading succeeded. Perhaps you were publishing at about
    the same time someone else was; you might get a merge conflict when
    trying to push.

    (There's a temptation to ignore this error: the artifact uploaded
    OK; nobody expects a git merge conflict when publishing. Alas,
    ignoring the error now means that your *next* publish will probably
    fail, since Pants has lost track of the current version number.)

    See: <a pantsref="publish_pushdb_push">Troubleshoot a Failed Push to Origin</a>

How To
------

-   Does your organization enforce a special branch for publishing?
    (E.g., perhaps publishing is only allowed on the `master` branch.)
    If so, be on that branch with no changes.
-   Consider trying a local publish first. This lets you test the
    to-be-published artifact. See
    <a pantsref="publish_local_test">Test with a Fake Local "Publish"</a>.
-   Start the publish:
    `./pants publish --no-dryrun [target]` Don't wander
    off; Pants will ask for confirmation as it goes (making sure you
    aren't publishing artifact[s] you didn't mean to).

Restricting to "Release Branch"
-------------------------------

Your organization might have a notion of a special "release branch": you
want all publishing to happen on this source control branch, which you
maintain extra-carefully. You can
<a pantsref="setup_publish_restrict_branch">configure your repo so that the
`publish` goal only allows `publish`-ing from this special branch</a>.

Authenticating to the Artifact Repository
-----------------------------------------

Your artifact repository probably doesn't accept anonymous uploads; you
probably need to authenticate (prove that you are really you). Depending
on how the artifact repository set up, Pants might need to interact the
authentication system. (Or it might not. E.g., if your system uses
Kerberos, when Pants invokes artifact-upload commands, Kerberos tickets
should work automatically.)

If Pants needs to provide your username and password, you can enable
this via Pants' `.netrc` support. Pants can parse [.netrc
files](http://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-File.html)
to get a user's username and password on an artifact repository machine.
To make this work:

-   Each user needs a `~/.netrc` file with a section that looks like:

        machine maven.twttr.com
          login sandy
          password myamazingpa$sword

-   One of your `BUILD` files needs a target that represents `netrc`
    auth:

        netrc = netrc()

        credentials(
          name = 'netrc',
          username=netrc.getusername,
          password=netrc.getpassword)

-   Your `'auth'` section for that repository should refer to that
    target:

        [jar-publish]
        workdir: %(pants_workdir)s/publish
        repos: {
            'public': {
              # ivysettings.xml resolver to use for publishing
              # this resolver's address should match root of ivysettings resolver
              'resolver': 'maven.twttr.com',
              'confs': ['default', 'sources', 'docs', 'changelog'],
              'auth': 'build-support:netrc',
              'help': 'Configure your ~/.netrc for artifact repo access!'
            },
        }

If you need to implement some other kind of authentication, you might
look at [the Netrc
implementation](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/backend/authentication/netrc_util.py)
and the <a pantsref="bdict_credentials">`credentials`</a> target type for inspiration.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Sometimes publishing doesn't do what you want. The fix usually involves publishing again, perhaps
passing `--override` (override the version number to use), `--force`, and/or `--restart-at`. The
following are some usual symptoms/questions:

<a pantsmark="publish_version_exists"></a>

### Versioned Artifact Already Exists

Pants attempted to compute the new version number to use based on the
contents of the pushdb; but apparently, someone previously published
that version of the artifact without updating the pushdb.

Examine the publish repo to find out what version number you actually
want to use. E.g., if you notice that versions up to 2.5.7 exist and you
want to bump the patch version, you want to override the default version
number and use 2.5.8 instead.

Try publishing again, but pass `--override` to specify the version number to use instead of
incrementing the version number from the pushdb. Be sure to use a version number that has not
already been published this time. For example, to override the default publish version number for
the `org.archie` buoyancy artifact, you might pass
`publish --override=org.archie#buoyancy=2.5.8`.

<a pantsmark="publish_pushdb_push"></a>

### Failed to Push to Origin

You might successfully publish your artifact but then fail to push your pushdb change to origin:

    To https://git.archimedes.org/owls
     ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.archimedes.org/owls'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
    hint: before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

For some reason, git couldn't merge your branch (with the pushdb change)
to the branch on origin. This might happen, for example, if you were
"racing" someone else; they perhaps pushed their change to master's
pushdb before you could. But it can also happen for other reasons; any
local change that can't be merged to the branch on origin.

You are now in a bad state: you've pushed some artifacts, but the pushdb
doesn't "remember" them.

-   Look at the pushdb's source control history to if someone made a
    conflicting publish. If so, contact them. (You're about to try to
    fix the problem; if they also encountered problems, they are
    probably also about to fix the problem. You might want to coordinate
    and take turns.)

**Resetting to try again**

In git, this might mean:

    git reset origin/master # (if ``master`` is your release branch)
    git pull origin master
    ./pants publish <your previous args>

Since you uploaded new versioned artifacts but the reset pushdb doesn't "remember" that, you might
get "Versioned Artifact Already Exists" errors: see the section above and use `--override` to
set version numbers to avoid these.

<a pantsmark="publish_no_provides"></a>

### Does not provide an artifact

A published artifact lives at a set of coordinates. For Pants to publish
an artifact, it needs to know the artifact's coordinates. Pants gets the
coordinates from the target's `provides` parameter. Thus, if you try to
publish a target that depends on a target that has no `provides`, Pants
doesn't know what to do. It stops:

    FAILURE: The following errors must be resolved to publish.
      Cannot publish BuildFileAddress(/Users/archie/workspace/buoyancy/client/src/main/scala/com/bu
    oyancy/client/BUILD, client) due to:
        BuildFileAddress(/Users/archie/workspace/buoyancy/client/src/main/scala/com/buoyancy/client
    /model/BUILD, model) - Does not provide an artifact.

The solution is to add a `provides` to the target that lacks one.

Remember, to publish a target, the target's dependencies must also be
published. If any of those dependencies have changed since their last
publish, Pants tries to publish them before publishing the target you
specify. Thus, you might need to add a `provides` to one or more of
these.

### Silently does not publish

A published artifact lives at a set of coordinates. For Pants to publish
an artifact, it needs to know the artifact's coordinates. Pants gets the
coordinates from the target's `provides` parameter. Thus, if you try to
publish a target that has no `provides`, Pants doesn't try. If the
target depends on *other* targets that *do* provide artifacts, Pants
might publish those. This is a case of
<a pantsref="tut_goal_target_mismatch">goal-target mismatch</a>
To fix this, set `provides` correctly.

Want to Publish Something? Publish Many Things
----------------------------------------------

If you publish a library that depends on others, you want to publish
them together. Conversely, if you publish a low-level library that other
libraries depend upon, you want to publish those together, too. Thus, if
you want to publish one thing, you may find you should publish many
things. Pants eases *part* of this: if you publish a library, it
automatically prompts you to also publish depended-upon libraries whose
source code changed. However, Pants does *not* automatically publish
dependees of a depended-upon library. If you know you're about to
publish a low-level library (perhaps via a "dry run" publish), you can
use Pants' `dependees` to find other things to publish.

For example, suppose your new library `high-level` depends on another
library, `util`. If you tested `high-level` with `util` version 1.2, you
want `util` 1.2 published and available to `high-level` consumers. Once
you publish `util` version 1.2, people might use it. If you previously
published your `another-high-level` library library depending on `util`
version 1.1, `another-high-level` consumers (who might also consume
`high-level`) might pick up version 1.2 and be sad to find out that
`other-high-level` doesn't work with the new `util`.

In this example, when you publish `high-level`, Pants knows to also
publish `util`. If Pants publishes `util`, it does *not* automatically
try to publish `high-level` or `other-high-level`.

<a pantsmark="publish_local_test"></a>

Test with a Fake Local "Publish"
--------------------------------

The whole reason you publish an artifact so that other codebases can use
it. Before you really publish, you might want to fake-publish an
artifact: generate it and put it someplace a place in your development
machine; then use that artifact from another codebase.

For example, your other codebase might use Maven to build, perhaps with
Maven configured to use `~/.m2/repository` as a local repo. You can make
pants publish to that local repo with:

    :::bash
    ./pants publish --no-dryrun --local=~/.m2/repository

In the other codebase, change the dependencies to pull in the new
artifact.

If your other codebase *also* uses Pants build, you can depend on the
locally-published artifact. If the artifact is a jar, then in the
3rdparty
<a pantsref="bdict_jar">`jar` target</a>, set `mutable=True` and change the
version number.

Setting Up Your Workspace
-------------------------

To get Pants publish working in the first place, someone needs to
<a pantsref="setup_publish">configure your codebase</a>
to register one or more
artifact repositories and, optionally, enable some features.
