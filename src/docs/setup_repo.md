Set up Your Source Tree for Pants
=================================

**As of September 2014, this much more complex than it should be.**
**The Pants community is actively working to simplify it.**
If you're setting up the Pants build tool to work in your source tree, you need to
configure Pants' behavior. (Once it's set up, most folks should be able
[[to use Pants as normal|pants('src/docs:first_concepts')]]
and not worry about these things.)

Configuring with `pants.ini`
----------------------------

Pants Build is very configurable. Your source tree's top-level directory
should contain a `pants.ini` file that sets various options. You can
modify a broad range of options here, including specific binaries to
use in your toolchain, arguments to pass to tools, etc.

These files are formatted as [Python config
files](http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#inst-config-syntax),
parsed by
[ConfigParser](http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html). Thus,
they look something like:

    :::ini
    [section]
    setting1: value1
    setting2: value2

The `[DEFAULT]` section is special: its values are available in other
sections. It's thus handy for defining values that will be used in
several contexts, as in these excerpts that define/use `thrift_workdir`:

    :::ini
    [DEFAULT]
    thrift_workdir: %(pants_workdir)s/thrift

    [gen.thrift]
    workdir: %(thrift_workdir)s

    [compile.java]
    args: [
      '-C-Tnowarnprefixes', '-C%(thrift_workdir)s',
    ]

It's also handy for defining values that are used in several contexts,
since these values will be available in all those contexts. The code
that combines DEFAULT values with others is in Pants'
[option/config.py](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/option/config.py).

Configure Pants' own Runtime Dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Pants calls out to other tools. E.g., it optionally uses `scalastyle` to check scala source code.
Most tools come pre-configured by Pants. A few do require more setup though and these rely on
special targets in your workspace to specify versions of the tools to fetch. These targets all live
in the `BUILD.tools` file by convention. For example, when Pants fetches `scalastyle`, it looks in
`BUILD.tools` for that target:

!inc[start-at=scalastyle&end-before=scrooge-gen](../../BUILD.tools)

When setting up your Pants repo, you may want to copy this file over from a working Pants repo and
perhaps change some version numbers to fit your situation.

**Note**: pants ships expecting a specific main class and command line interface for all jvm tools
it uses; so, if the version you specify does not match either of those expectations, pants will
fail when it tries to call the tool.

Set up source roots
-------------------

Maybe some day all the world's programmers will agree on the one true directory structure for
source code. Until then, Pants must deduce where the 'root' of a source tree is, so it can
correctly set up import paths, correctly bundle code etc.

In all typical cases, Pants can deduce the source roots automatically based on naming conventions.
E.g., `src/<lang>`, `src/main/<lang>`, `test/<lang>`, `src/test/<lang>`, `3rdparty/lang` and so on.
However if your source roots don't conform to any of the default patterns, you can add your own
patterns.  See ` ./pants help-advanced source` for details.

Setting up `BUILD` files
------------------------

Pants is well-suited to large multi-project workspaces. You probably have a lot of code
organized in a big directory tree. [[The usual BUILD file advice|pants('src/docs:build_files')]]
applies here.

<a pantsmark="setup_mvn2pants"> </a>

**If you're converting a `mvn`-built workspace to use Pants**, you can get a head start by using
information from your `pom.xml` files. The [`mvn2pants`](https://github.com/ericzundel/mvn2pants)
shows some scripts that convert `pom.xml` files into `BUILD` files; Square wrote and used these
to convert some projects. This can get you up and running with Pants faster. Careful, though:
Maven projects tend to be "coarser-grained" than Pants projects. Once you have things working,
you'll probably want to replace the big automatically-generated targets with things that follow
the 1:1:1 rule.

`BUILD.*` and environment-specific config
-----------------------------------------

When we say `BUILD` files are named `BUILD`, we really mean `BUILD` or <tt>BUILD.*something*</tt>.
If you have some rules that make sense for folks in one environment but not others, you might put
them into a separate BUILD file named <tt>BUILD.*something*</tt>. For example, you might have
some `BUILD` config that you'd like to ship with your open-source code but some other parts to
keep internal. You can put open-source things in `BUILD.oss` and internal things in
`BUILD.internal`. Pants "sees" both of these. When shipping open-source code, you can hold back
the `BUILD.internal` file.

Configure JVM Artifact Downloads
--------------------------------

Pants uses `Ivy` to fetch libraries external to the repo (also called 3rdparty libraries).
Ivy uses an XML configuration file.  By default, pants uses the configuration that ships with Ivy,
but if you need to change ivy settings you can specify your own in `pants.ini`:

    [ivy]
    ivy_settings: %(pants_supportdir)s/ivy/ivysettings.xml
    cache_dir: ~/.ivy2/pants

Note that pants overrides Ivy's `ivy.cache.dir` property with the value of the --ivy-cache-dir
pants option.

For more information on Ivy settings, see the [Ivy documentation](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/)


Integrate New Tools via a Pants Plugin
--------------------------------------

Pants knows how to build many things, but maybe you need it to learn a new tool.
Maybe your organization has a custom linter, a custom code generator, or some other custom tool.
Maybe your organization uses a tool that, while not custom, has not yet been integrated with Pants.

-   If your organization has some custom tools to integrate, set up a
    [[Pants plugin|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_plugin')]].
-   If you want to integrate with a not-custom tool, you still want to
    set up a Pants plugin (or perhaps add abilities to an existing
    plugin), but it might make sense to
    [[get your changes in upstream|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_contribute')]].

`BUILD.*` in the source tree for special targets
------------------------------------------------

If you distribute code to different organizations, you might want to
expose some targets to one organization but not to another. You can do
this by defining those targets in a `BUILD.*` file. You can give that
file to some people and not give it to others. This code will be
processed by people invoking pants on this directory only if they have
the file.

For example, you might work at the Foo Corporation, which maintains a
fleet of machines to run big test jobs. You might define a humungous
test job as a convenient way to send many many tests to the fleet:

    :::python
    # src/javatest/com/foo/BUILD.foo

    # many-many test: Run this on the fleet, not your workstation
    # (unless you want to wait a few hours for results)
    junit_tests(name='many-many',
    dependencies = [
      'bar:all',
      'baz:all',
      'garply:all',
    ])

If you don't want to make this test definition available to the public
(lest they complain about how long it takes), you might put this in a
BUILD.foo file and hold back this file when mirroring for the public
repository.

Enabling Pants Publish
----------------------

Pants can ease [["publishing"|pants('src/docs:publish')]]: uploading versioned compiled artifacts.
There are some special things to set up to enable and customize publishing.

### Tell Pants about your Artifact Repository

To tell Pants which artifact repository to publish to, [[Create a
plugin|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_plugin')]] if you haven't already. Register it with Pants.

In the plugin, define and register at least one `Repository` object in a `BUILD` file alias as
shown in
[`src/python/internal_backend/repositories/register.py`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/internal_backend/repositories/register.py).

`BUILD` targets can use this Repository's alias as the `repo` parameter to an <a
pantsref="bdict_artifact">`artifact`</a>. For example,
[examples/src/java/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/greet/BUILD](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/examples/src/java/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/greet/BUILD)
refers to the `public` repository defined above. (Notice it's a Python object, not a string.)

!inc[start-at=java_library](../../examples/src/java/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/greet/BUILD)

If you get an error that the repo name (here, `public`) isn't defined, your plugin didn't register
with Pants successfully. Make sure you bootstrap Pants in a way that loads your `register.py`.

In your config file (usually `pants.ini`), set up a `[publish.jar]` section. In that section,
create a `dict` called `repos`. It should contain a section for each `Repository` object that you
defined in your plugin:

    repos: {
      'public': {  # must match the name of the `Repository` object that you defined in your plugin.
        'resolver': 'maven.example.com', # must match hostname in ~/.netrc and the <url> parameter
                                         # in your custom ivysettings.xml.
        'auth': 'build-support:netrc',   # Pants spec to a 'credentials()' object.
        'help': 'Configure your ~/.netrc for maven.example.com access.'
      },
      'testing': {
        'resolver': 'artifactory.example.com',
        'auth': 'build-support:netrc',
        'help': 'Configure your ~/.netrc for artifactory.example.com access.'
      },
    }

If your repository requires authentication, add a `~/.netrc` file. Here is a sample file, that
matches the `repos` specified above:

    machine maven.example.com
      login someuser
      password password123

    machine artifactory.example.com
      login someuser
      password someotherpassword123

And place the following in a `BUILD` file somewhere in your repository (`build-support/BUILD` is a
good place, and is used in the example above):

    netrc = netrc()

    credentials(
      name = 'netrc',
      username=netrc.getusername,
      password=netrc.getpassword)

Next, tell Ivy how to publish to your repository. Add a new `ivysettings.xml` file to your repo
with the additional information needed to publish artifacts. Here is an example to get you started:

   :::xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>

    <ivysettings>
      <settings defaultResolver="chain-repos"/>

      <credentials host="artifactory.example.com"
                   realm="Artifactory Realm"
                   <!-- These values come from a credentials() object, which is fed by '~/.netrc'.
                        There must be a '~/.netrc' machine entry which matches a resolver in the
                        "repos" object in 'pants.ini', which also matches the 'host' in this XML
                        block. -->
                   username="${login}"
                   passwd="${password}"/>

      <resolvers>
        <chain name="chain-repos" returnFirst="true">
           <ibiblio name="corp-maven"
                         m2compatible="true"
                         usepoms="true"
                         root="https://artifactory.example.com/content/groups/public/"/>
        </chain>

        <url name="artifactory.example.com" m2compatible="true">
          <artifact pattern="https://artifactory.example.com/libs-releases-local/[organization]/[module]/[revision]/[module]-[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]"/>
        </url>
      </resolvers>
    </ivysettings>

With this file in place, add a `[publish]` section to `pants.ini`, and tell pants to use
the custom Ivy settings when publishing:

    ivy_settings: %(pants_supportdir)s/ivy/ivysettings_for_publishing.xml

<a pantsmark="setup_publish_restrict_branch"> </a>

### Restricting Publish to "Release Branch"

Your organization might have a notion of a special "release branch": you want [[artifact
publishing|pants('src/docs:publish')]] to happen on this source control branch, which you maintain
extra-carefully. You can set this branch using the `restrict_push_branches` option of the
`[publish.jar]` section of your config file (usually `pants.ini`).

### Task to Publish "Extra" Artifacts

Pants supports "publish plugins", which allow end-users to add additional, arbitrary files to be
published along with the primary artifact. For example, let's say that along with publishing your
jar full of class files, you would also like to publish a companion file that contains some
metadata -- code coverage info, source git repository, java version that created the jar, etc. By
[[developing a task|pants('src/python/pants/docs:dev_tasks')]] in a
[[plugin|pants('src/python/pants/docs:howto_plugin')]], you give Pants a new ability. [[Develop a
Task to Publish "Extra" Artifacts|pants('src/python/pants/docs:dev_tasks_publish_extras')]] to find
out how to develop a special Task to include "extra" data with published artifacts.

<a id="setup_cache"></a>

Outside Caches
--------------

You can tell Pants to use outside caches when building. Pants automatically caches much of its
work in its working directory. But you can tell it to use (and generate) pre-built things in
another directory or a remote RESTful server. E.g, to use a shared server for cached builds,
and having set up such a server, set `cache` options in `pants.ini`:

    [cache]
    read_from: ['https://myserver.co/pantscache']
    write_to: ['https://myserver.co/pantscache']

When building, Pants first tries to read built things from places in `read_from`.
If it builds something, it caches those built things in places in  `write_to`.
(It's handy that these are separate settings; if members of your organization can install wacky
tools on their laptops, you might not want their builds to write to a particular cache, but would 
want them to be able to read from it.)

Valid option values include

* `[ 'https://myserver.co/pcache' ]` RESTful server URL
* `[ '/tmp/pantscache' ]` local machine file location
* `[ 'https://myserver.us/pcache|https://myserver.bf/pcache' ]` pipe-separated list of URLs--Pants pings each and uses fastest
* `[ '/tmp/pantscache', 'https://myserver.co/pcache' ]` try local fs first, then remote server

For a list of allowed values see the `_do_create_artifact_cache` docstring in
[`cache_setup.py`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/cache/cache_setup.py)

To make a cache server, you need to write it. It's basically a RESTful server that can handle
`GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests on big binary blobs. If you implement this via `nginx`,
then the `dav_methods PUT DELETE;` directive is good. (You might want to add some
organization-specific business logic on top of that. E.g., if you're worried about the
"wacky laptop tools" case, your server should only accept artifacts from known-legitimate
machines.)
When *reading* from a cache server, Pants tries to `GET` an URL at some path under the server URL;
respond with 404 if there's nothing there, 200 if there is.
When *writing* to a cache server, Pants first tries a `HEAD` request to see if the file's already
there; respond with 404 if there's nothing there, 200 if there is. If Pants gets a 404, it will
then try a `PUT` request; store the file it sends.
If the user's `.netrc` has authentication information for the cache server[s], Pants will use it.
(Thus, if only some users with known-good setups should be able to write to the cache, you might
find it handy to use `.netrc` to authenticate those users.)

Uploading Timing Stats
----------------------

Pants tracks information about its performance: what it builds, how much
time various build operations take, cache hits, and more.
If you you work with a large engineering organization, you might want to
gather this information in one place, so it can inform decisions about how
to improve everybody's build times.

In everyone's `pants.ini` files, in the `[DEFAULT]` section, add a
`stats_upload_url` line:

    stats_upload_url: "http://myorg.org/pantsstats"

Pants `POST`s reports to that URL. It's up to you to write a server to "listen"
at that URL. A `POST` can have the following fields:

`artifact_cache_stats`: Information about Pants' caching.
[This "cache" refers to the place where Pants can store and fetch things it
builds](#setup_cache) (not to be confused with the information it keeps in its working
directory or the pre-built artifacts it fetches from PyPI or maven).
This field is JSON. If Pants did *not* exercise its cache in a run, this might
be an empty list "`[]`". If Pants *did* exercise its cache, this JSON might
look like:

    :::javascript
    [{"num_hits": 2,
      "hits": ["3rdparty:hamcrest-core", "3rdparty:junit"],
      "num_misses": 1,
      "cache_name": "default",
      "misses": ["examples/tests/java/com/pants/examples/hello/greet"]}]

`run_info`: Miscellaneous info about the Pants run: SCM status, build
failure/success, etc. This is formatted as a JSON dictionary. It might look
like:

    :::javascript
    {"timestamp": "1422901742.05",
     "datetime": "Monday Feb 02, 2015 10:29:02",
     "machine": "pogo-desktop",
     "default_report": "/home/lahosken/src/lpants/.pants.d/reports/pants_run_2015_02_02_10_29_02_54/html/build.html",
     "tag": "release_0.0.27-153-g7daeafc",
     "user": "lahosken",
     "branch": "cache_printf",
     "path": "/home/lahosken/src/lpants",
     "outcome": "SUCCESS",
     "cmd_line": "./pants test examples/tests/java/com/pants/examples/hello::",
     "id": "pants_run_2015_02_02_10_29_02_54",
     "revision": "7daeafc8b40dc9bdad532195d510b8ed520aaa7c"}

`self_timings`, `cumulative_timings`: Timing information about the stages of
the build. These stages "nest". If stage1 invokes stage2, then the
`cumulative_timings` for `stage1` include the `stage2` time, but the
`self_timings` for `stage1` will not. Each of these fields is a JSON-encoded
list of structures. The start of `cumulative_timings` might look like

    :::javascript
    [{"timing": 3.3389577865600586, "is_tool": false, "label": "main"},
     {"timing": 2.929041862487793, "is_tool": false, "label": "background"},
     {"timing": 1.560438871383667, "is_tool": false, "label": "main:test"},
     {"timing": 1.479201078414917, "is_tool": false, "label": "main:test:junit"},
     {"timing": 1.262120008468628, "is_tool": false, "label": "main:compile"},
     {"timing": 1.118539810180664, "is_tool": true, "label": "main:test:junit:bootstrap-junit"},
     {"timing": 0.7393410205841064, "is_tool": false, "label": "main:compile:checkstyle"},
     {"timing": 0.7151470184326172, "is_tool": true, "label": "main:compile:checkstyle:checkstyle"},
     ...

Using Pants behind a firewall
------------

Pants may encounter issues running behind a firewall. Several components expect to be able to reach the Internet:

* Ivy bootstrapper
* Binary tool bootstrapping
* Ivy itself (used for tool bootstrapping and downloading external .jar files)
* Python requirements


### Configuring the Python requests library

Code in bootstrapper.py and other parts of Pants use the Python
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library to
download resources using http or https.  The first time you may
encounter this is when Pants attempts to download an initial version
of ivy.  If this initial download is through a proxy, the requests
library uses the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to
find the proxy server.

```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.corp.example.com:123
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.corp.example.com:456
```

If you are using Pants configured to find resources with HTTPS urls, you may see an error like:

```
Exception message: Problem fetching the ivy bootstrap jar! Problem GETing data from https://artifactserver.example.com/content/groups/public/org/apache/ivy/ivy/2.3.0/ivy-2.3.0.jar: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:581)
```

The requests library attempts to verify SSL certificates by default.
The reason it is denying the request is that it cannot find a trusted
public key for the root certificate authority presented by the server.
The requests library uses the 'certifi' library of well known
certificate authorities, if that library is installed.  If you are
using a virtualenv installation of pants, using `pip
install certifi` to add the certify package to your pants environment
might help.  You can also download a .pem bundle from the
[certifi project page](http://certifi.io/en/latest/) and set
`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` as mentioned below.

If you are using hosts with a self-signed certificate, your
certificate authority will not be available in the certifi library.
You will need a `.pem` file for the local certificate authority.

You can tell the requests library about your trusted certificate
authority certificates by setting the environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`.
This variable should point to a file containing trusted certificates:

```
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/certs/latest.pem
```

### Ivy bootstrapper and tool bootstrapping

[Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) is used as a way to download
the tools that Pants uses and for tool bootstrapper and external
artifacts.

Pants fetches the Ivy tool with an initial manual bootstrapping
step using the Python requests library.  If you do not want to use `HTTP_PROXY` or
`HTTPS_PROXY` as described above, you can re-redirect this initial download to another
URL with a setting in pants.ini:

```
[ivy]
bootstrap_jar_url: https://proxy.corp.example.com/content/groups/public/org/apache/ivy/ivy/2.3.0/ivy-2.3.0.jar
```

You may also encounter issues downloading this .jar file if you are
using self-signed SSL certificates. See the section on Configuring the Python requests library
above.


### Using Ivy with a proxy

If you are using a version of pants 0.0.30 or greater, you can just set the `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables and Pants will automatically configure the proxies for Ivy.
If you are using an earlier version of pants, you must setup the system properties to
Ivy.  One way to do this is in pants.ini:

```
[bootstrap.bootstrap_jvm_tools]
jvm_options: [
    "-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.com",
    "-Dhttp.proxyPort=123",
    "-Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.com",
    "-Dhttps.proxyPort=456",
  ]
```

Alternatively, if you have a custom `ivysettings.xml` file, you can set these values through
the `<properties>` configuration item.


## Nexus as proxy

If your site uses Sonotype Nexus or another reverse proxy for
artifacts, you do not need to use a separate HTTP proxy.  Contact the
reverse proxy administrator to setup a proxy for the sites listed in
`build-support/ivy/settings.xml` and `pants.ini`.  Currently, these
sites are `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/` and `https://dl.bintray.com/pantsbuild/maven/`:

Here is an excerpt of a modified ivysettings.xml with some possible configurations:

```
<macrodef name="_remote_resolvers">
    <chain returnFirst="true">
      <ibiblio name="example-corp-maven"
               m2compatible="true"
               usepoms="true"
               root="https://nexus.example.com/content/groups/public/"/>
      <ibiblio name="maven.twttr.com-maven"
               m2compatible="true"
               usepoms="true"
               root="https://nexus.example.com/content/repositories/maven.twttr.com/"/>
  </chain>
</macrodef>
```

### Redirecting tool downloads to other servers

For the binary support tools like protoc, you will need to setup a
proxy for the `dl.bintray.com` repo, or create your own repo of build
tools:

```
pants_support_baseurls = [
    "https://nexus.example.com/content/repositories/dl.bintray.com/pantsbuild/bin/build-support"
	]
```

### Redirecting python requirements to other servers

For python repos, you need to override the following settings in pants.ini:

```
[python-repos]
repos: [
    "https://pantsbuild.github.io/cheeseshop/third_party/python/dist/index.html",
    "https://pantsbuild.github.io/cheeseshop/third_party/python/index.html"
  ]

indices: [
    "https://pypi.python.org/simple/"
  ]
```
