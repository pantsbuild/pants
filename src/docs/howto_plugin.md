Developing a Pants Plugin
=========================

This page documents how to develop a Pants plugin, a set of code that
defines new Pants functionality. If you
[[develop a new task|pants('src/docs:dev_tasks')]]
or target to add to Pants (or to
override an existing part of Pants), a plugin gives you a way to
register your code with Pants.

Much of Pants' own functionality is organized in plugins; see them in
[`src/python/pants/backend/*`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/src/python/pants/backend).

A plugin registers its functionality with Pants by defining some
functions in a `register.py` file in its top directory. For example,
Pants' `jvm` code registers in
[src/python/pants/backend/jvm/register.py](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/register.py)
Pants' backend-loader code assumes your plugin has a `register.py` file
there.

A "Hello World" plugin
----------------------

This "Hello World" plugin example shows how to register a plugin with Pants. It defines a new 
`hello-world` goal with two tasks. Here's how to create it:

- If you don't have an existing Pants project to work with, create one. Locate its config file,
 typically `pants.ini` in the repo root.

- Create a directory for your plugins. In this example we will use the `plugins/` directory in 
the repo root, but there is no convention, and you can put them wherever you like.

- In the `plugins/` directory, create following filesystem structure:

        :::
        hello/
          __init__.py
          register.py
          tasks/
             __init__.py
             your_tasks.py
      
        
- `__init__.py` files can be empty - you're just saying to Python that you created modules.

- In `your_tasks.py` place the following content:

        :::python
        from pants.task.task import Task
          
        class HelloTask(Task):
            def execute(self):
                print("Hello")
         
        class WorldTask(Task):
            def execute(self):
                print("world!")

   [Task](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/task/task.py) is a simple base
   class for your tasks - you must implement the `execute` method.
   
- In `register.py` place the following content:

        :::python
        from pants.goal.goal import Goal
        from pants.goal.task_registrar import TaskRegistrar as task
        from hello.tasks.your_tasks import HelloTask, WorldTask
        
        def register_goals():
            Goal.register(name="hello-world", description="Say hello to your world")
            task(name='hello', action=HelloTask).install('hello-world')
            task(name='world', action=WorldTask).install('hello-world')
 
 This creates a new goal named `hello-world`, and registers the two tasks to it.


- In `pants.ini` place the following content:
  
        :::ini
        [GLOBAL]
        pants_version: 1.9.0
        pythonpath: ["%(buildroot)s/plugins"]
        backend_packages: ["hello"]     

`backend_packages` defines which plugins you want to use in your project.

If you want to use custom plugins directly from source when building in the same repo, you need 
to put them on the `pythonpath` so Pants can find them. 


- You are ready to use your plugin! First try to find your goal by typing `./pants goals`:

        :::
        ...
        hello-world: Say hello to your world
        ...

Now you can use your plugin by typing `./pants hello-world`:

        ::
        ...
        Executing tasks in goals: hello-world
        XX:XX:XX 00:00   [hello-world]
        XX:XX:XX 00:00     [hello]Hello
        
        XX:XX:XX 00:00     [world]world!
        
        XX:XX:XX 00:00   [complete]
                       SUCCESS

Note that to consume the custom plugin as a published artifact (say on PyPI), instead of 
directly from the repo, then instead of `backend_packages` and `pythonpath` you would set `plugins`:

        :::ini
        [GLOBAL]
        pants_version: 1.9.0
        plugins: ["myorg.hello==1.7.6"]

Similarly, if your custom plugin is consumed directly from the repo, but has dependencies on 
published artifacts, then you list those in `plugins`:
     
        :::ini
        [GLOBAL]
        pants_version: 1.9.0
        pythonpath: ["%(buildroot)s/plugins"]
        backend_packages: ["hello"]
        plugins: ["some.dependency==4.5.11"]

See below for more details. 
  
     
Simple Configuration
--------------------

If you want to extend Pants without adding any 3rd-party libraries that aren't already referenced by
Pants, you can use the following technique using sources stored directly in your repo.
All you need to do is name the package where the plugin is defined, and the pythonpath entry to
load it from.

In the example below, the stock `JvmBinary` target is subclassed so that a custom task (not shown)
can consume it specifically but disregard regular `JvmBinary` instances (using `isinstance()`).

- Define a home for your plugins. In this example we'll use a top-level `plugins/` directory but
  this is not special.

- Create an empty `plugins/hadoop/targets/__init__.py` to define a python package structure
  for your custom hadoop target type plugin. Also create empty `__init__.py` files in each
  directory up to but not including the root directory of your python package layout; in this case,
  just `plugins/hadoop/__init__.py`.

- Create a python module for your custom target type in `plugins/hadoop/targets/hadoop_binary.py`:

        :::python
        # plugins/hadoop/targets/hadoop_binary.py
        from pants.backend.jvm.targets.jvm_binary import JvmBinary


        class HadoopBinary(JvmBinary):
          pass


- Create `plugins/hadoop/register.py` to register the elements exposed by your plugin to BUILD file
  authors:

        :::python
        # plugins/hadoop/register.py

        from pants.build_graph.build_file_aliases import BuildFileAliases
        from hadoop.targets.hadoop_binary import HadoopBinary

        def build_file_aliases():
          return BuildFileAliases(
            targets={
              # NB: This allows a HadoopBinary target to be created in a BUILD file using the
              # hadoop_binary alias.
              'hadoop_binary': HadoopBinary,
            },
          )


- In `pants.ini`, add your new plugin package to the list of backends to load when pants starts.
  This instructs pants to load a module named `hadoop.register`.

        :::ini
        [GLOBAL]
        pythonpath: [
            '%(buildroot)s/plugins',
          ]
        backend_packages: [
            'hadoop',
          ]

Note that you can also set the PYTHONPATH in your `./pants` wrapper script, instead of in
`pants.ini`, if you have other reasons to do so. Either way, pants will look for a `register.py`
file for each backend package you list by prefixing that package with the python path; ie roughly
`pythonpath + backend package + register.py` is tried for each pythonpath prefix until a
`register.py` is found, in this example `plugins/hadoop/register.py`.

Examples from `twitter/commons`
-------------------------------

For an example of a code repo with plugins to add features to Pants when building in that repo,
take a look at [`twitter/commons`](https://github.com/twitter/commons), especially its
[`pants-plugins` directory](https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/32011ab5351fea23e8c70e24e752540b06d1389f/pants-plugins).

The repo's [`pants.ini` file](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/32011ab5351fea23e8c70e24e752540b06d1389f/pants.ini) has a
`backend_packages` entry listing the plugin packages (packages with `register.py` files):

    :::ini
    [GLOBAL]
    pythonpath: [
        "%(buildroot)s/pants-plugins/src/python",
      ]
    backend_packages: [
        'twitter.common.pants.jvm.extras',
        'twitter.common.pants.python.commons',
        'pants.contrib.python.checks',
      ]

The [`...jvm/extras/register.py`](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/pants-plugins/src/python/twitter/common/pants/jvm/extras/register.py)
file registers a `checkstyle` goal. To find the code for this task, come back to the
`pantsbuild/pants` repo: Pants defines the
[`Checkstyle` task class](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/tasks/checkstyle.py) but doesn't register it. 
But other Pants workspaces can register it, as `twitter/commons` illustrates.
