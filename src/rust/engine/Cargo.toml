# This is the set of packages which are expected to work on any arbitrary system that checks out the code.
# It should be exactly equivalent to members, except without any packages that require more system
# configuration than we're comfortable doing in our bootstrap scripts.
#
# In particular, it does not contain the fs/brfs package, which will not compile without a fuse installation.
# On Ubuntu, that means installing libfuse-dev. On OSX, that means installing OSXFUSE.

# unfortunately, enabling `extension-module` causes tests linked against `pyo3` to fail. We
# define a feature to enable that, but we do not enable it by default: someone building this module
# in order to extract `libengine.so` should pass `cargo build .. --features=extension-module`.
