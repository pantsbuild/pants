# notify is currently an experimental API, we are pinning to https://docs.rs/notify/5.0.0-pre.1/notify/
# because the latest prerelease at time of writing has removed the debounced watcher which we would like to use.
# The author suggests they will add the debounced watcher back into the stable 5.0.0 release. When that happens
# we can move to it.
