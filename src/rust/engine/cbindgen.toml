// Handle is declared as a typedef rather than a wrapper struct because it avoids needing to wrap
// the inner handle/`void*` in a tuple or datatype at the ffi boundary. For most types that
// overhead would not be worth worrying about, but Handle is used often enough that it gives a 6%
// speedup to avoid the wrapping.
