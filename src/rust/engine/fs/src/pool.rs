/// A wrapper around a CpuPool, to add the ability to drop the pool before forking,

/// When a process forks, the kernel clones only the thread that called fork: all other
/// threads are effectively destroyed. If a CpuPool has live threads during a fork, it
/// will not be able to perform any work or be dropped cleanly (it will hang instead).
/// It's thus necessary to drop the pool before forking, and to re-create it after forking.
