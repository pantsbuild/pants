        // We (might) need to initialize the value.
        //
        // Because this code executes a side effect which could be observed elsewhere within this
        // process (other threads can observe the contents of the temporary directory), we need to
        // ensure that if this method is cancelled (via async Drop), whether the cell has been
        // initialized or not stays in sync with whether the side effect is visible.
        //
        // Making the initialization "cancellation safe", involves either:
        //
        //   1. Adding a Drop guard to "undo" the side effect if we're dropped before we fully
        //      initialize the cell.
        //       * This is challenging to do correctly in this case, because the `Drop` guard cannot
        //         be created until after initialization begins, but cannot be cleared until after the
        //         cell has been initialized (i.e., after `get_or_try_init` returns).
        //   2. Shielding ourselves from cancellation by `spawn`ing a new Task to guarantee that the
        //      cell initialization always runs to completion.
        //       * This would work, but would mean that we would finish initializing cells even when
        //         work was cancelled. Cancellation usually means that the work is no longer necessary,
        //         and so that could result in a lot of spurious IO (in e.g. warm cache cases which
        //         never end up actually needing any inputs).
        //       * An advanced variant of this approach would be to _pause_ work on materializing a
        //         Digest when demand for it disappeared, and resume the work if another caller
        //         requested that Digest.
        //   3. Using anonymous destination paths, such that multiple attempts to initialize cannot
        //      collide.
        //       * This means that although the side effect is visible, it can never collide.
        //
        // We take the final approach here currently (for simplicity's sake), but the advanced variant
        // of approach 2 might eventually be worthwhile.
