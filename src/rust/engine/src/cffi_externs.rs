// This file creates the unmangled symbols initnative_engine and PyInit_native_engine, which cffi
// will use as the entry point to this shared library in python 2 and python 3, respectively.
//
// It calls the extern'd wrapped_initnative_engine and wrapped_PyInit_native_engine (generated in
// src/rust/engine/src/cffi/native_engine.c by build-support/native-engine/bootstrap_cffi.py).
// This is a bit awkward and fiddly, but necessary because rust doesn't currently have a way to
// re-export symbols from C libraries, other than this.
// See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36342
