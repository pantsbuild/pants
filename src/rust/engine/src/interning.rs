///
/// A struct that encapsulates interning of python `Value`s as comparable `Key`s.
///
/// To minimize the total amount of time spent in python code comparing objects (represented on
/// the rust side of the FFI boundary as `Value` instances) to one another, this API supports
/// memoizing `Value`s as `Key`s.
///
/// Creating a `Key` involves interning a `Value` under a (private) `InternKey` struct which
/// implements `Hash` and `Eq` using the precomputed python `__hash__` for the `Value` and
/// delegating to python's `__eq__`, respectively.
///
/// Currently `Value`s are interned indefinitely as `Key`s, meaning that they can never
/// be collected: it's possible that this can eventually be improved by either:
///
///   1) switching to directly linking-against or embedding python, such that the `Value`
///      type goes away in favor of direct usage of a python object wrapper struct.
///   2) This structure might begin storing weak-references to `Key`s and/or `Value`s, which
///      would allow the associated `Value` handles to be dropped when they were no longer used.
///      The challenge to this approach is that it would make it more difficult to pass
///      `Key`/`Value` instances across the FFI boundary.
///   3) `Value` could implement `Eq`/`Hash` directly via extern calls to python (although we've
///      avoided doing this so far because it would hide a relatively expensive operation behind
///      those usually-inexpensive traits).
///
/// To avoid deadlocks, methods of Interns require that the GIL is held, and then explicitly release
/// it before acquiring inner locks. That way we can guarantee that these locks are always acquired
/// before the GIL (Value equality in particular might re-acquire it).
