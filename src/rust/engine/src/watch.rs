/// TODO: To simplify testing the InvalidationWatcher we could create  a trait which

/// take an argument that implements the trait.
/// Then we wouldn't have to mock out a Graph object in watch_tests.rs. This will probably
/// only be possible when we remove watchman invalidation, when the one code path for invaldation will be
