/*

N.B. This build script is invoked by `cargo` by way of this configuration
in our Cargo.toml:

    [project]
    ...
    build = "src/cffi_build.rs"

Within, we use the `gcc` crate to compile the CFFI C sources (`native_engine.c`)
generated by `bootstrap.sh` into a (private) static lib (`libnative_engine_ffi.a`),
which then gets linked into the final `cargo build` product (the native engine binary).
This process mixes the Python module initialization function and other symbols into the
native engine binary, allowing us to address it both as an importable python module
(`from _native_engine import X`) as well as a C library (`ffi.dlopen(native_engine.so)`).

  // __gxx_personality_v0 which is present in the C++ standard library.
  // I don't know why. It shouldn't, and before grpcio 0.2.0, it didn't.
  //
  // So we need to link against the C++ standard library. Nothing under us
  // in the dependency tree appears to export this fact.
  // Ideally, we would be linking dynamically, because statically linking
  // against libstdc++ is kind of scary. But we're only doing it to pull in a
  // bogus symbol anyway, so what's the worst that can happen?
  //
  // The only way I can find to dynamically link against libstdc++ is to pass
  // `-C link-args=lstdc++` to rustc, but we can only do this from a
  // .cargo/config file, which applies that argument to every compile/link which
  // happens in a subdirectory of that directory, which isn't what we want to do.
  // So we'll statically link. Because what's the worst that can happen?
  //
  // The following do not work:
  //  * Using the link argument in Cargo.toml to specify stdc++.
  //  * Specifying `rustc-flags=-lstdc++`
  //    (which is equivalent to `-ldylib=stdc++`).
  //  * Specifying `rustc-link-lib=stdc++`
  //    (which is equivalent to `rustc-link-lib=dylib=stdc++).
