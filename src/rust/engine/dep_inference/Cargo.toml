# NB: The Major/Minor is loosely tied to Pants version of the latest breaking change.
# The patch version should be incremented every time a breaking change is cherry-picked.
# So when you're making a change on `main`:
# - Set this to main's Major/Minor.0 if it isn't already
# - Otherwise, increment the patch number
# Then when/if you cherry-pick and it fails, simply increment the patch number on the target branch.
#
# (A "breaking change" is one that changes the behavior of dependency parsing. This version is
# embedded in the local cache. Therefore if behavior changes, the cache should be busted)
