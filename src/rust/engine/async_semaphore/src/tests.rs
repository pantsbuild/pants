  // it a signal via the unblock_thread1 channel. This means that any futures that
  // try to acquire the semaphore will be queued up until we unblock thread .
  //
  // Next we spawn a future on a second thread that tries to acquire the semaphore,
  // and get added to the waiters queue, we drop that future after a Delay timer
  // completes. The drop should cause the task to be removed from the waiters queue.
  //
  // Then we spawn a 3rd future that tries to acquire the semaphore but cannot
  // because thread1 still has the only permit. After this future is added to the waiters
  // we unblock thread1 and wait for a signal from the thread3 that it acquires.
  //
  // If the SECOND future was not removed from the waiters queue we would not get a signal
  // that thread3 acquired the lock because the 2nd task would be blocking the queue trying to
  // poll a non existant future.
