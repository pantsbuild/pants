# NB: We don't list the components (namely `clippy` and `rustfmt`) and instead rely on either the
#  the profile being "default" (by-and-large the default profile) or the nice error message from
#  `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` if the required component isn't installed
#  This is so the Pants-compiled engine (which uses the "minimal" profile) doesn't download/install
#  these as they are unnecessary.
