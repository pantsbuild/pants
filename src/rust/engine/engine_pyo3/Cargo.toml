# NB: To actually load this crate from python, the `extension-module` feature must be enabled. But
# unfortunately, enabling `extension-module` causes tests linked against `pyo3` to fail. We
# define a feature to enable that, but we do not enable it by default: someone building this module
# in order to extract `libengine_pyo3.so` should pass `cargo build .. --features=engine_pyo3/extension-module`.

# We must disable the `auto-initialize` feature because we do not enable `extension-module` normally
# (see above comment in `features`), so `auto-initialize` would try to link to a static Python interpreter during
# tests, which may fail. However, we need to then re-activate the `macros` feature. See
# https://pyo3.rs/v0.13.2/features.html
