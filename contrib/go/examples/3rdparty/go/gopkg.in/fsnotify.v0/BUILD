  # NB: We pin this rev since without a pin, integration tests hit the github API to resolve the
  # latest compatible v1 tag/branch and this runs into rate-limit issues quickly on Travis CI.
  # To test resolution of the v0 tag, simply comment out the rev below and run:
  #   ./pants compile contrib/go/examples/3rdparty/go/gopkg.in/fsnotify.v0 -ldebug
  # The compile should work and the debug output should show v0.9.3 (or higher v0.X.Y) being
  # selected.
  rev='v0.9.3'
