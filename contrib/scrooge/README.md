Pants plugins to support the [Scrooge](https://github.com/twitter/scrooge) thrift code generator

Currently there is a code gen plugin for generating java and scala struct and rpc bindings for
thrift IDLs as well as a thrift-linter plugin for running basic lint checks against thrift IDLs
that will be used with the scrooge code generator.
