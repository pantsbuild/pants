Python 3rdparty Pattern
=======================

In general, we use the
[[3rdparty idiom|pants('src/docs:3rdparty')]] to organize
dependencies on code from outside the source tree. This document
describes how to make this work for Python code.

Your Python code can pull in code written elsewhere. Pants fetches code
via a library that uses pip-style specifications (name and
version-range).

3rdparty/python
---------------

To keep all of your code depending on the same versions of third-party
Python artifacts, you might use the idiom of keeping them in a directory
tree under `3rdparty/python`. If your organization has many such
dependencies, you might arrange them in several directories: this can
ease later "git detective work" when finding out who changed a version.
(Pants itself doesn't have so many Python dependencies; thus, its `3rdparty` tree doesn't
have many directories.)

**pip-style requirements.txt:**

To define some third-party dependencies, use a
<a pantsref="bdict_python_requirements">python_requirements</a> in your `BUILD`
file and make a pip `requirements.txt` file in the same directory.

E.g, your `3rdparty/python/BUILD` file might look like:

!inc[start-at=python_requirement&end-before=target](../../../../3rdparty/python/BUILD)

...with `3rdparty/python/requirements.txt` like:

!inc[end-before=mox](../../../../3rdparty/python/requirements.txt)

`python_requirements` defines a named target for each line in the
`requirements.txt` line. For example, a line like `ansicolors==1.0.2` in
`requirements.txt` defines a target named `ansicolors` that pulls in
ansicolors version 1.0.2.

**python\_requirement\_library and python\_requirement:**

A `BUILD` file can also define requirements without a `requirements.txt`
file. Set up a
<a pantsref="bdict_python_requirement_library">`python_requirement_library`</a>
with one or more
<a pantsref="bdict_python_requirement">`python_requirement`</a>s
like:

    :::python
    python_requirement_library(
      name='beautifulsoup',
      requirements=[
        python_requirement(name='beautifulsoup',
                           requirement='BeautifulSoup==3.2.0'),
      ])

Your Code's BUILD File
----------------------

In your code's `BUILD` file, introduce a dependency on the `3rdparty`
target:

!inc[start-at=python_library](hello/greet/BUILD)

Then in your Python code, you can `import` from that package:

    :::python
    from colors import green
