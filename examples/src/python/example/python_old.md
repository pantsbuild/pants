Why use Pants for Python development?
-------------------------------------

Pants makes the manipulation and distribution of hermetically sealed
Python environments painless.

But why another system?

### Alternatives

There are several solutions for package management in Python. Almost
everyone is familiar with running sudo easy\_install PackageXYZ. This
leaves a lot to be desired. Over time, your Python installation will
collect dozens of packages, become annoyingly slow or even broken, and
reinstalling it will invariably break a number of the applications that
you were using.

A marked improvement over the sudo easy\_install model is
[virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) to isolate Python environments
on a project by project basis. This is useful for development but does
not directly solve any problems related to deployment, whether it be to
a production environment or to your peers. It is also challenging to
explain to a Python non-expert.

A different solution altogether, [zc.buildout](http://www.buildout.org/)
attempts to provide a framework and recipes for many common development
environments. It has arguably gone the farthest for automating
environment reproducibility amongst the popular tools, but shares the
same complexity problems as all the other abovementioned solutions.

Most solutions leave deployment as an afterthought. Why not make the
development and deployment environments the same by taking the
environment along with you?

### Pants and PEX

The lingua franca of Pants is the PEX file (PEX itself does not stand
for anything in particular, though in spirit you can think of it as a
"Python EXecutable".)

**PEX files are single-file lightweight virtual Python environments.**

The only difference is no virtualenv setup instructions or
pip install foo bar baz. PEX files are self-bootstrapping Python
environments with no strings attached and no side-effects. Just a simple
mechanism that unifies both your development and your deployment.

Getting started
---------------

First it is necessary to install Pants. See
<!-- TODO(lahosken) proper link-->
[Installing Pants](http://pantsbuild.github.io/install.html).

It is also helpful to read the
<!-- TODO(lahosken) proper link-->
[Pants Conceptual Overview](http://pantsbuild.github.io/first_concepts.html).

TL;DR - 'Hello world!' with Pants Python
----------------------------------------

    $ git clone git://github.com/twitter/commons
    $ cd commons
    $ mkdir -p src/python/twitter/my_project
    $ vi src/python/twitter/my_project/BUILD

`src/python/twitter/my_project/BUILD`:

    python_binary(
      name = 'hello_world',
      source = 'hello_world.py'
    )

    $ vi src/python/twitter/my_project/hello_world.py

`src/python/twitter/my_project/hello_world.py` might have contents:

    print('Hello world!')

To run directly:

    $ ./pants py src/python/twitter/my_project:hello_world
    Build operating on target: PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/my_project/BUILD:hello_world)
    Hello world!

To build:

    $ ./pants src/python/twitter/my_project:hello_world
    Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/my_project/BUILD:hello_world)])
    Building PythonBinary PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/my_project/BUILD:hello_world):
    Wrote /Users/wickman/clients/science-py-csl/dist/hello_world.pex

and run separately:

    $ dist/hello_world.pex
    Hello world!

NOTE: The first time you run `./pants` will likely take a ridiculous
amount of time as Pants bootstraps itself inside your directory. Note,
it never installs anything in a global site-packages.

Describing Python environments in Pants
---------------------------------------

Build dependencies in Pants are managed with `BUILD` files that are
co-located with your source. These files are used to describe the
following:

1.  libraries: bundles of sources and resources, that may or may not
    also depend on other libraries
2.  binaries: a single source (the executable) and libraries it depends
    upon
3.  requirements: external dependencies as resolved by dependency
    managers e.g. pypi in Python or ivy on the JVM

The main point of Pants is to take these BUILD files and do something
useful with them.

### BUILD file format

These descriptions are stored in files named BUILD and colocated near
the binaries/libraries they describe. Let's take for example the
src/python/twitter/tutorial subtree in commons:

    $ ls -lR src/python/twitter/tutorial/
    total 16
    -rw-r--r--  1 wickman  wheel  137 Apr  9 22:59 BUILD
    -rw-r--r--  1 wickman  wheel  118 Apr  9 22:59 hello_world.py

Let's take a look at the BUILD file in
`src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD`:

    python_binary(
      name = "hello_world",
      source = "hello_world.py",
      dependencies = [
        pants("src/python/twitter/common/app"),
      ]
    )

This BUILD file names one target: hello\_world, which is a
<a xref="bdict_python_binary">python\_binary target</a>.
The hello\_world target contains one source file,
hello\_world.py and depends upon one other target, the format of which
will be described shortly.

It should be noted that sources are relative to the location of the
BUILD file itself, e.g. hello\_world.py inside of
src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD actually refers to
`src/python/twitter/tutorial/hello_world.py`:

    from twitter.common import app

    def main():
      print('Hello world!')

    app.main()

Dependencies, on the other hand, are relative to the *source root* of
the repository which is defined by the BUILD file that sits next to the
pants command:

    # Define the repository layout

    source_root('src/antlr', doc, page, java_antlr_library, python_antlr_library)
    source_root('src/java', annotation_processor, doc, jvm_binary, java_library, page)
    source_root('src/protobuf', doc, java_protobuf_library, page)
    source_root('src/python', doc, page, python_binary, python_library)
    source_root('src/scala', doc, jvm_binary, page, scala_library)
    source_root('src/thrift', doc, java_thrift_library, page, python_thrift_library)

    source_root('tests/java', doc, java_library, java_tests, page)
    source_root('tests/python', doc, page, python_library, python_tests, python_test_suite)
    source_root('tests/scala', doc, page, scala_library, scala_tests)

This file can be tailored to map to any source root structure such as
Maven style, Twitter style (as described above) or something more flat
such as a `setup.py`-based project. This however is an advanced topic that
is not covered in this document.

### Addressing targets

Within the src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD, only one target is
defined, specifically hello\_world. This target is addressed by
src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello\_world which means the target
hello\_world within src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD. In general,
targets take the form `<path>:<target name>` with the special cases:

1.  in the case of path/to/directory/BUILD:target, the BUILD component
    may be elided and instead path/to/directory:target may be used
2.  path/to/directory is short form for path/to/directory:directory, so
    src/python/twitter/common/app is short form for
    src/python/twitter/common/app/BUILD:app

src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD referenced
pants('src/python/twitter/common/app') in its dependencies. The pants()
keyword is akin to a "pointer dereference" for an address. It will point
to whatever target is described at that address, in this case a
python\_library target:

`src/python/twitter/common/app/BUILD`:

    python_library(
      name = "app",
      sources = globs('*.py'),
      dependencies = [
        pants('src/python/twitter/common/dirutil'),
        pants('src/python/twitter/common/lang'),
        pants('src/python/twitter/common/options'),
        pants('src/python/twitter/common/util'),
        pants('src/python/twitter/common/app/modules'),
      ]
    )

which in turn includes even more dependencies. The job of Pants is to
manage the transitive closure of all these dependencies and manipulate
collections of these targets for you.

### Python target types

BUILD files themselves are just Python. The only thing magical is that
the statement `from pants import *` has been autoinjected. This provides
a number of Python-specific targets such as:

1.  python\_library
2.  python\_binary
3.  python\_requirement
4.  python\_thrift\_library

and a whole host of other targets including Java, Scala, Python,
Markdown, the universal pants target and so forth. See
src/python/pants/\_\_init\_\_.py for a comprehensive list of targets.

#### python\_library

A python\_library target has a name, zero or more source files, zero or
more resource files, and zero or more dependencies. These dependencies
may include other python\_library-like targets (python\_library,
python\_thrift\_library, python\_antlr\_library and so forth) or
python\_requirement targets.

#### python\_binary

A python\_binary target is almost identical to a python\_library target
except instead of sources, it takes one of two possible parameters:

1.  `source`: The source file that should be executed within the
    "library" otherwise defined by python\_binary

2. `entry_point`: The entry point that should be executed within the
"library" otherwise defined by python\_binary. Entry points take the
format of pkg\_resources.EntryPoint, which is something akin to
some.module.name:my.attr which means run the function pointed by my.attr
inside the module some.module inside the environment. The :my.attr
component can be omitted and the module is executed directly (presuming
it has a \_\_main\_\_.py.)

#### python\_requirement

A python\_requirement target describes an external dependency as
understood by easy\_install or pip. It takes only a single non-keyword
argument of the Requirement-style string, e.g. :

    python_requirement('django-celery')
    python_requirement('tornado==2.2')
    python_requirement('kombu>=2.1.1,<3.0')

This will resolve the dependency and its transitive closure, for example
django-celery pulls down the following dependencies: `celery>=2.5.1`,
`django-picklefield>=0.2.0`, `ordereddict`, `python-dateutil`,
`kombu>=2.1.1,<3.0`, `anyjson>=0.3.1`, `importlib`, and `amqplib>=1.0`.

Pants takes care of handling these dependencies for you. It will never
install anything globally. Instead it will build the dependency and
cache it in .pants.d and assemble them a la carte into an execution
environment.

The python\_requirement for a particular dependency should appear only
once in a BUILD file. It creates a local target name which can then be
included in other dependencies in the file.:

    python_requirement('django-celery')

    python_library(
      name = 'mylib_1',
      sources = [
        'mylib_1.py',
      ],
      dependencies = [
        pants(':django-celery')
      ]
    )

    python_library(
      name = 'mylib_2',
      sources = [
        'mylib_2.py',
      ],
      dependencies = [
        pants(':django-celery')
      ]
    )

#### python\_thrift\_library

A python\_thrift\_library target takes the same arguments as
python\_library arguments, except that files described in sources must
be thrift files. If your library or binary depends upon this target
type, Python bindings will be autogeNerated and included within your
environment.

#### python\_tests

A python\_tests target takes the same arguments as python\_library
arguments, with the addition of the optional coverage argument that is a
list of namespaces that you want to generate coverage data for.

Building your first PEX
-----------------------

Now you're ready to build your first PEX file (technically you already
have, by building Pants itself.) By default if you specify
`./pants <target>`, it assumes you mean `./pants build <target>` and
does precisely that:

    $ PANTS_VERBOSE=1 ./pants src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello_world
    Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world)])
      Resolver: Calling environment super => 0.046ms
    Building PythonBinary PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world):
    Building PythonBinary PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world):
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/app/BUILD:app) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/dirutil/BUILD:dirutil) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/lang/BUILD:lang) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/options/BUILD:options) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/util/BUILD:util) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/app/modules/BUILD:modules) [relative module: ]
      Resolver: Calling environment super => 0.016ms
      Dumping binary: twitter/tutorial/hello_world.py
    Wrote /private/tmp/wickman-commons/dist/hello_world.pex

You will see that despite specifying just one dependency, the transitive
closure of hello\_world pulled in all of src/python/twitter/common/app
and its direct descendants. That's because those library targets
depended upon other library targets, than in turn depending on even
more. At the end of the day, we bundle up the closed set of all
dependencies and bundle them into hello\_world.pex.

Since it uses the twitter.common.app framework, we know we can fire it
up and poke around with `--help`:

    $ dist/hello_world.pex --help
    Options:
      -h, --help, --short-help
                            show this help message and exit.
      --long-help           show options from all registered modules, not just the
                            __main__ module.

If we specify --long-help, we can see the help of transitively included
modules, e.g. twitter.common.app itself:

    $ dist/hello_world.pex --long-help
    Options:
      -h, --help, --short-help
                            show this help message and exit.
      --long-help           show options from all registered modules, not just the
                            __main__ module.

      From module twitter.common.app:
        --app_daemonize     Daemonize this application. [default: False]
        --app_profile_output=FILENAME
                            Dump the profiling output to a binary profiling
                            format. [default: None]
        --app_daemon_stderr=TWITTER_COMMON_APP_DAEMON_STDERR
                            Direct this app's stderr to this file if daemonized.
                            [default: /dev/null]
        --app_debug         Print extra debugging information during application
                            initialization. [default: False]
        --app_daemon_stdout=TWITTER_COMMON_APP_DAEMON_STDOUT
                            Direct this app's stdout to this file if daemonized .
                            [default: /dev/null]
        --app_profiling     Run profiler on the code while it runs.  Note this can
                            cause slowdowns. [default: False]
        --app_ignore_rc_file
                            Ignore default arguments from the rc file. [default:
                            False]
        --app_pidfile=TWITTER_COMMON_APP_PIDFILE
                            The pidfile to use if --app_daemonize is specified.
                            [default: None]

Or we can simply execute it as intended:

    $ dist/hello_world.pex
    Hello world!

Environment manipulation with pants py
--------------------------------------

We've only discussed so far the "pants build" command. There's also a
dedicated "py" command that allows you to manipulate the environments
described by python\_binary and python\_library targets, such as drop
into an interpreter with the environment set up for you.

### pants py semantics

The default behavior of `pants py <target>` is the following:

1.  For python\_binary targets, build the environment and execute the
    target
2.  For one or more python\_library targets, build the environment that
    is the transitive closure of all targets and drop into an
    interpreter.
3.  For a combination of python\_binary and python\_library targets,
    build the transitive closure of all targets and execute the first
    binary target.

### external dependencies

Let's take src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD and split out the
dependencies from our hello\_world target into hello\_world\_lib and add
dependencies upon [Tornado](http://github.com/facebook/tornado) and
[psutil](http://code.google.com/p/psutil/).

    python_binary(
      name = "hello_world",
      source = "hello_world.py",
      dependencies = [
        pants(":hello_world_lib")
      ]
    )

    python_library(
      name = "hello_world_lib",
      dependencies = [
        pants("src/python/twitter/common/app"),
        python_requirement("tornado"),
        python_requirement("psutil"),
      ]
    )

This uses the python\_requirement target which can refer to any string
in pkg\_resources.Requirement format as recognized by tools such as
easy\_install and pip as described above.

Now that we've created a library-only target
src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello\_world\_lib, let's drop into it using
pants py with verbosity turned on so that we can see what's going on in
the background:

    $ PANTS_VERBOSE=1 ./pants py src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello_world_lib
    Build operating on target: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world_lib)
      Resolver: Calling environment super => 0.019ms
    Building PythonBinary PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world_lib):
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world_lib) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/app/BUILD:app) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/dirutil/BUILD:dirutil) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/lang/BUILD:lang) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/options/BUILD:options) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/util/BUILD:util) [relative module: ]
      Dumping library: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/common/app/modules/BUILD:modules) [relative module: ]
      Dumping requirement: tornado
      Dumping requirement: psutil

    Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Aug 31 2011, 15:49:05)
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>> 

In the background, pants used cached version of tornado but fetched
psutil from pypi and any necessary transitive dependencies (none in this
case) and built a platform-specific version for us.

You can convince yourself that the environment contains all the
dependencies by inspecting sys.path and importing libraries as you
desire:

    >>> import psutil
    >>> help(psutil)
    >>> from twitter.common import app
    >>> help(app)

It should be stressed that *dependencies built by Pants are never
installed globally*. These dependencies only exist for the duration of
the Python interpreter forked by Pants.

### Running an application using pants py

Let us turn our hello\_world.py into a basic top application using
`tornado`:

    from twitter.common import app

    import psutil
    import tornado.ioloop
    import tornado.web

    class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
      def get(self):
        self.write('<pre>Running pids:\n%s</pre>' % '\n'.join(map(str, psutil.get_pid_list())))

    def main():
      application = tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler)
      ])
      application.listen(8888)
      tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()

    app.main()

We have now split our application into two parts: the hello\_world
binary target and the hello\_world\_lib library target. If we run
pants py
src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello\_world\_lib, the default behavior is
to drop into an interpreter.

If we run pants py src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello\_world, the default
behavior is to run the binary target pointed to by `hello_world`:

    $ ./pants py src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello_world

Then point your browser to <http://localhost:8888>

### pants py --pex

There is also a --pex option to pants py that allows you to build a PEX
file from a union of python\_library targets that does not necessarily
have a python\_binary target defined for it. Since there is no entry
point specified, the resulting .pex file just behaves like a Python
interpreter, but with the sys.path bootstrapped for you:

    $ ./pants py --pex src/python/twitter/tutorial:hello_world_lib
    Build operating on target: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:hello_world_lib)
    Wrote /private/tmp/wickman-commons/dist/hello_world_lib.pex

    $ ls -la dist/hello_world_lib.pex
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 wickman  wheel  1404174 Apr 10 13:00 dist/hello_world_lib.pex

Now if you use dist/hello\_world\_lib.pex, since it has no entry point,
it will drop you into an interpreter:

    $ dist/hello_world_lib.pex
    Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Aug 31 2011, 15:49:05)
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>> import tornado

As mentioned before, it's like a single-file lightweight alternative to
a virtualenv. We can even use it to run our hello\_world.py application:

    $ dist/hello_world_lib.pex src/python/twitter/tutorial/hello_world.py

This can be an incredibly powerful and lightweight way to manage and
deploy virtual environments without using virtualenv.

### PEX file as interpreter

As mentioned above, PEX files without default entry points behave like
Python interpreters that carry their dependencies with them. For
example, let's create a target that provides a Fabric dependency within
`src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD`:

    python_library(
      name = 'fabric',
      dependencies = [
        python_requirement('Fabric')
      ]
    )

And let's build a fabric PEX file:

    $ ./pants py --pex src/python/twitter/tutorial:fabric
    Build operating on target: PythonLibrary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:fabric)
    Wrote /private/tmp/wickman-commons/dist/fabric.pex

By default it does nothing more than drop us into an interpreter:

    $ dist/fabric.pex
    Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Aug 31 2011, 15:49:05)
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>>

But suppose we have a local script that depends upon Fabric,
`fabric_hello_world.py`:

    from fabric.api import *

    def main():
      local('echo hello world')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

We can now use fabric.pex as if it were a Python interpreter but with
fabric available in its environment. Note that fabric has never been
installed globally in any site-packages anywhere. It is just bundled
inside of fabric.pex:

    $ dist/fabric.pex fabric_hello_world.py
    [localhost] local: echo hello world
    hello world

### python\_binary entry\_point

An advanced feature of python\_binary targets, you may in addition
specify direct entry points into PEX files rather than a source file.
For example, if we wanted to build an a la carte fab wrapper for fabric:

    python_binary(name = "fab",
      entry_point = "fabric.main:main",
      dependencies = [
        python_requirement("fabric"),
      ]
    )

We build:

    $ ./pants src/python/twitter/tutorial:fab

    Building PythonBinary PythonBinary(src/python/twitter/tutorial/BUILD:fab):
    Wrote /private/tmp/wickman-commons/dist/fab.pex

And now dist/fab.pex behaves like a standalone fab binary:

    $ dist/fab.pex -h
    Usage: fab [options] <command>[:arg1,arg2=val2,host=foo,hosts='h1;h2',...] ...

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d NAME, --display=NAME
                            print detailed info about command NAME
      -F FORMAT, --list-format=FORMAT
                            formats --list, choices: short, normal, nested
      -l, --list            print list of possible commands and exit
      --set=KEY=VALUE,...   comma separated KEY=VALUE pairs to set Fab env vars
      --shortlist           alias for -F short --list
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      -a, --no_agent        don't use the running SSH agent
      -A, --forward-agent   forward local agent to remote end
      --abort-on-prompts    abort instead of prompting (for password, host, etc)
      ...

Pants also has excellent support for JVM-based builds and can do similar
things like resolving external JARs and packaging them as standalone
environments with default entry points.

Python Tests
------------

By default Python tests are run via pytest. Any option that py.test has
can be used since arguments are passed on by pants.

### Defining python\_tests Targets

When setting up your test targets, the BUILD file will be something
like:

    python_tests(
      name = "your_tests",
      sources = globs("*.py"),
      coverage = ["twitter.your_namespace"],
      dependencies = [
        pants("3rdparty/python:mock")
        pants("src/python/twitter/your_namespace")
     ]
    )

The above target is very similar to a python\_library with the addition
of the coverage argument. coverage allows you to retrict the namespaces
for which code coverage data is generated.

### Running Python Tests

To run your Python tests, you use ./pants build although build can be
left off:

    $ ./pants tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests
    Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonTests(tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests)])
    ================================================== test session starts ===================================================
    platform darwin -- Python 2.6.7 -- pytest-2.3.5
    collected 15 items:

    tests/python/twitter/your_tests/module1_test.py ....
    tests/python/twitter/your_tests/module2_test.py ....
    tests/python/twitter/your_tests/module3_test.py ....

    =============================================== 15 passed in 0.44 seconds ================================================
    tests.python.twitter.your_tests.your_tests                                    .....   SUCCESS

Sometimes you only want to run specific tests (or exclude them). The -k
option controls the tests to run. -k will do substring matches on test
method names and can also use keywords like not and or to refine
results.

    $ ./pants tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests -k 'module1_instantiation_test or module1_foo_test' -v
    Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonTests(tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests)])
    ================================================== test session starts ===================================================
    platform darwin -- Python 2.6.7 -- pytest-2.3.5

    tests.python.twitter.your_tests.your_tests                                    .....   SUCCESS

You can also mark tests via a decorator:

    @pytest.mark.module1
    def module1_instantiation_test():
        # testing code here

Using -m you can specify the marks of tests that you want to execute.

### Getting Python Code Coverage

To get code coverage data, set the PANTS\_PY\_COVERAGE environment
variable:

    $ PANTS_PY_COVERAGE=1 ./pants tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests
    Build operating on targets: OrderedSet([PythonTests(tests/python/twitter/your_tests/BUILD:your_tests)])
    ============================================================ test session starts ============================================================

### Interactve Debugging on Test Failure

Passing --pdb to your test build will invoke the Python debugger if one
of the tests fails. This can be useful for inspecting the stat of
objects especially if you are mocking interfaces.

### Using Other Testing Frameworks

Although most tests can run under pytest, if you need to use a different
testing framework, you can. Set the entry\_point keyword argument when
calling python\_tests:

    python_tests(
      name = 'tests',
      sources = [],
      dependencies = [
        pants('src/python/twitter/infraops/supplybird:supplybird-lib'),
        pants('3rdparty/python:mock')
      ],
      entry_point="twitter.infraops.supplybird.core.run_tests"
    )

The entry\_point should exit with a non-zero status if there are any
test failures.

Keep in mind, however, that much of the above documentation assumes you
are using pytest.

Manipulating PEX behavior with environment variables
----------------------------------------------------

Given a PEX file, it is possible to alter its default behavior during
invocation.

### PEX\_INTERPRETER=1

If you have a PEX file with a prescribed executable source or
entry\_point specified, it may still occasionally be useful to drop into
an interpreter with the environment bootstrapped. If you set
PEX\_INTERPRETER=1 in your environment, the PEX bootstrapper will skip
any execution and instead launch an interactive interpreter session.

### PEX\_VERBOSE=1

If your environment is failing to bootstrap or simply bootstrapping very
slowly, it can be useful to set PEX\_VERBOSE=1 in your environment to
get debugging output printed to the console. Debugging output includes:

1.  Fetched dependencies
2.  Built dependencies
3.  Activated dependencies
4.  Packages scrubbed out of sys.path
5.  The sys.path used to launch the interpreter

### PEX\_MODULE=entry\_point

If you have a PEX file without a prescribed entry point, or want to
change the entry\_point for the duration of a single invocation, you can
set PEX\_MODULE=entry\_point using the same format as described in the
python\_binary Pants target.

This can be a useful tool for bundling up a number of packages together
and being able to use a single file to execute scripts from each of
them.

Another common pattern is to link pytest into your PEX file, and run
PEX\_MODULE=pytest my\_pex.pex tests/\*.py to run your test suite in its
isolated environment.

### PEX\_COVERAGE

There is nascent support for performing code coverage within PEX files
by setting `PEX_COVERAGE=<suffix>`. By default the coverage files will
be written into the current working directory with the file pattern
`.coverage.<suffix>`. This requires that the coverage Python module has
been linked into your PEX.

You can then combine the coverage files by running PEX\_MODULE=coverage
my\_pex.pex .coverage.suffix\* and run a report using
PEX\_MODULE=coverage
my\_pex.pex report. Since PEX files are just zip files, coverage is able
to understand and extract source and line numbers from them in order to
produce coverage reports.

How PEX files work
------------------

### the utility of zipimport and \_\_main\_\_.py

As an aside, in Python, you may not know that you can import code from
directories:

    $ mkdir -p foo
    $ touch foo/__init__.py
    $ echo "print 'spam'" > foo/bar.py
    $ python -c 'import foo.bar'
    spam

All that is necessary is the presence of \_\_init\_\_.py to signal to
the importer that we are dealing with a package. Similarly, a directory
can be made "executable":

    $ echo "print 'i like flowers'" > foo/__main__.py
    $ python foo
    i like flowers

And because the zipimport module now provides a default import hook for
Pythons \>= 2.4, if the Python import framework sees a zip file, with
the inclusion of a proper \_\_init\_\_.py, it can be treated similarly
to a directory. But since a directory can be executable, if we just drop
a \_\_main\_\_.py into a zip file, it suddenly becomes executable:

    $ pushd foo && zip /tmp/flower.zip __main__.py && popd
    /tmp/foo /tmp
      adding: __main__.py (stored 0%)
    /tmp
    $ python flower.zip
    i like flowers

And since zip files don't actually start until the zip magic number, you
can embed arbitrary strings at the beginning of them and they're still
valid zips. Hence simple PEX files are born:

    $ echo '#!/usr/bin/env python2.6' > flower.pex && cat flower.zip >> flower.pex
    $ chmod +x flower.pex
    $ ./flower.pex
    i like flowers

Remember pants.pex?

    $ unzip -l pants.pex | tail -2
    warning [pants.pex]:  25 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
      (attempting to process anyway)
     --------                   -------
      7900812                   543 files

    $ head -c 25 pants.pex
    #!/usr/bin/env python2.6

### PEX \_\_main\_\_.py

The \_\_main\_\_.py in a real PEX file is somewhat special:

    import os
    import sys

    __entry_point__ = None
    if '__file__' in locals() and __file__ is not None:
      __entry_point__ = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    elif '__loader__' in locals():
      from pkgutil import ImpLoader
      if hasattr(__loader__, 'archive'):
        __entry_point__ = __loader__.archive
      elif isinstance(__loader__, ImpLoader):
        __entry_point__ = os.path.dirname(__loader__.get_filename())

    if __entry_point__ is None:
      sys.stderr.write('Could not launch python executable!\n')
      sys.exit(2)

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(__entry_point__, '.bootstrap'))

    from twitter.common.python.importer import monkeypatch
    monkeypatch()
    del monkeypatch

    from twitter.common.python.pex import PEX
    PEX(__entry_point__).execute()

PEX is just a class that manages requirements (often embedded within PEX
files as egg distributions in the .deps directory) and autoimports them
into the sys.path, then executes a prescribed entry point.

If you read the code closely, you'll notice that it relies upon
monkeypatching zipimport. Inside the twitter.common.python library we've
provided a recursive zip importer derived from Google's [pure Python
zipimport](http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django10_zipimport.html)
module that allows for depending upon eggs within eggs or zips (and so
forth) so that PEX files need not extract egg dependencies to disk a
priori. This even extends to C extensions (.so and .dylib files) which
are written to disk long enough to be dlopened before being unlinked.

Strictly speaking this monkeypatching is not necessary and we may
consider making that optional.
