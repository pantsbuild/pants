HelloMain
=========

This program demonstrates how to configure Pants to build Java code.
It doesn't do much, but shows how BUILD files and .java code interrelate.

It's the example code for some pants documentation:

* [Pants: First Tutorial](http://pantsbuild.github.io/first_tutorial.html)
* [JVM Projects with Pants](http://pantsbuild.github.io/JVMProjects.html)
* [Pants: JVM 3rdparty Pattern](http://pantsbuild.github.io/3rdparty_jvm.html)

The Java code that does something, such as it is:

!inc[start-at=void main&end-before=private HelloMain](HelloMain.java)
