Scala Support
=============

Examples
--------

The sample code
[examples/src/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome/](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/examples/src/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome/)
shows how to define a library of Scala code.

Its `BUILD` file looks like that for a Java library, but contains a
`scala_library` target with `.scala` sources:

!inc[start-at=scala_library](hello/welcome/BUILD)

There's a sample test in
[examples/tests/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/examples/tests/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome).
It's a <a xref="bdict_junit_tests">`junit_tests`</a> with `.scala` sources.

!inc[start-at=junit_tests](../../../../../tests/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome/BUILD)


Scala/Java Circular Dependencies
--------------------------------

Scala code and Java code can depend on each other. As long as the dependencies aren't circular,
`scala_library` targets can depend on `java_library` targets and vice versa. If the dependencies
*are* circular, you can set up targets to compile all of this code together. Assuming your `*.java`
and `*scala` files are in separate directories, you can have:

-   a `java_library` whose `sources` param is the `*.java` files; one of its
    dependencies should be...
-   a `scala_library` whose `sources` param is the `*.scala` files and
    whose `java_sources` is the above `java_library`.

Do not put the `java_library` in the `scala_library`'s `dependencies` or Pants will error out in its
circular dependencies check. Instead, put the `java_library` in `java_sources` to work around this
check.

The [`scala_with_java_sources`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/examples/src/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/scala_with_java_sources)
example shows how this works:

!inc[start-at=scala_library](scala_with_java_sources/BUILD)

The referred-to
[`java_sources`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/master/examples/src/java/org/pantsbuild/example/java_sources/BUILD)
`java_library` has this `java_library` in its dependencies:

!inc[start-at=java_library](../../../../java/org/pantsbuild/example/java_sources/BUILD)

(If your circularly-referencing `*.scala` and `*.java` files are in the *same* directory, you don't
need separate `java_library` and `scala_library` targets. Instead, use
`scala_library(sources=globs('*.scala', '*.java'),...)`.)

Scala Version
-------------

You can override the default version of the entire Scala toolchain with the single
`--scala-platform-version` option. You can set that option to one of the supported Scala versions
(currently "2.10" or "2.11"), or to the special value "custom".

If you choose a custom version, you must use the `--scala-platform-runtime-spec`,
`--scala-platform-repl-spec` and `--scala-platform-suffix-version` options to provide
information about your custom Scala version.  The first two of these default to the target
addresses `//:scala-library` and `//:scala-repl` respectively, so you can simply define those
targets (in the root `BUILD.tools` file by convention) to point to the relevant JARs.


Scala REPL
----------

To bring up Scala's interactive console, use Pants'
<a xref="oref_goal_repl">`repl`</a> goal.
In the resulting console, you can `import` any Scala or Java code from the Pants invocation's
targets and their dependencies.

    $ ./pants repl examples/src/scala/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/welcome
       ...much build output...

Testing
-------

Scala tests are run using the `junit_tests` BUILD target.  Both Junit and ScalaTest tests are
supported by default.  Most other scala test frameworks support running with JUnit via a base
class/trait or via a `@RunWith` annotation; so you can use
`junit_tests` for your scala tests as well.

Formatting and Linting
----------------------

`scalafmt` and `scalafix` are installed by default in both the `fmt` and `lint` goals, but
"semantic" scalafix rewrites are disabled by default since most deployments will prefer that the
`lint` goal run quickly. Semantic rewrites introduce a dependency on compilation, and require an
additional compiler plugin.

### Usage

To run a particular scalafix rule on targets, pass:

    :::bash
    ./pants fmt.scalafix --rules=ProcedureSyntax ${TARGETS}

### Enabling semantic rewrites

Enabling `scalafix` semantic rewrites involves using a compiler plugin, and passing the
`--semantic` flag to the `scalafix` task.

In a `BUILD` file at the root of the repo, define the `semanticdb` compiler plugin:

    :::python
    SCALA_REV=2.11.11
    jar_library(
      name = 'scalac-plugin-dep',
      jars = [jar(org='org.scalameta', name='semanticdb-scalac_{}'.format(SCALA_REV), rev='2.0.1')],
    )

Then, reference it from `pants.ini` to load the plugin, and enable semantic rewrites to require
compilation for `fmt` and `lint`:

    :::ini
    [compile.zinc]
    args: [
        # The `-S` prefix here indicates that zinc should pass this option to scalac rather than
        # to javac (`-C` prefix).
        '-S-Yrangepos',
      ]

    scalac_plugins: [
        'semanticdb',
      ]

    [lint.scalafix]
    semantic: True

    [fmt.scalafix]
    semantic: True
