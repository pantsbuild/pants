# the PR.
#
# That means that we do not calculate skips based off what is in the overall PR, but rather what is
# in the changeset being pushed. For example, if a PR's first commit changes Rust and that gets
# pushed, then we will run the Rust tests for that build; but, if in a followup push, we don't
# make any further changes to Rust, then we will _not_ rerun those Rust tests by default in the
# new build.
