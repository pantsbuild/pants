# NB: this file duplicates travis_ci/Dockerfile, except it installs Python 2.7 with UCS2.
# We do not include this change directly in centos6/Dockerfile nor in travis_ci/Dockerfile
# because we only want access to this Python interpreter in the Build Wheels Linux UCS2 shard,
# so it is not helpful to other shards. Rather, it would make those shards more finicky to deal
# with by resulting in two Python 2.7 installs: system vs. pyenv.

# Use our custom Centos6 image for binary compatibility with old linux distros.
FROM pantsbuild/centos6:latest

# Note we use 2.7.15, rather than 2.7.13, as the centos6 image already comes with 2.7.13
# installed, which uses UCS4 instead of UCS2. This allows us to disambiguate which Python 2
# interpreter to use when `ci.sh` and `release.sh` set the interpreter constraints for
# Pants, and thus for the built ./pants.pex. We set $PY to the exact Python 2.7 version we want
# to ensure the PEX is bootstrapped with UCS 2.
