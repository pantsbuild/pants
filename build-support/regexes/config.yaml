# Note that for values that are regexes, how YAML interprets backslashes and other
# special characters matters. For example, an unquoted string is interpreted as a raw
# string with no escape characters (so it's particularly useful for expressing regexes).
# Adding quotes around these may change their meaning, so don't do so without thought.
