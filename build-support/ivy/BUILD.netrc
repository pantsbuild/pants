# Enable ~/.netrc for credentials management of jvm publishing.

# These credentials are used by our 'public' publish repo defined in [publish]repos in `pants.ini`
# and the username and password here are templated in to a credentials configuration for
# oss.sonatype.org in `build-support/ivy/publish.ivysettings.xml`.  This setup is complex, but
# documented well here: http://pantsbuild.org/setup_repo.html#enabling-pants-publish
