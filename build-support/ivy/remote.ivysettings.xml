    We tweak two attributes away from defaults:

    1. @descriptor: By default ivy does not require metadata (or successful metadata downloads).
       This can lead to jars downloading without their transitive deps which leads to confusing
       failures later when classpaths are constructed and used. We setup the maven central
       resolver to require successful pom downloads here.

    2. @root: We point remote execution at the RBE maven central mirror to avoid DDOSing maven
       central.
