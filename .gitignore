# TODO: We can probably delete these 3. They have not been used in a long time, if ever.
#  In fact there's a lot of things we can clean up in this .gitignore. It's not harmful
#  to keep them, but it's nice to keep things tight and avoid questions/confusion.

# TODO: .pids is no longer in use (it is now under .pants.d) but Pants developers switching
#  to older branches will still see files created under .pids, which will then linger when they
#  switch back to main. So we keep this in main's .gitignore for a while. We can remove this,
#  to reduce confusion, once we're no longer developing in branches prior to 2.19.x.
