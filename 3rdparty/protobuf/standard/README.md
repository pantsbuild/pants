This is a dump of the non-test .proto files from https://github.com/google/protobuf directory src/google/protobuf.

These are the .proto files which the protocol buffer compiler (protoc) expects to always be able to find.
In a standard protoc distribution, they would be in the include directory.

This dump was taken at git tag v3.1.0 which is sha a428e42072765993ff674fda72863c9f1aa2d268.
