# Note: Adding a third-party dependency is usually frowned upon because it increases the time
# to install Pants.
# This is particularly painful for CI, where the installation of Pants is often slow.
# Additionally, it increases the surface area of Pants's supply chain for security.
# Consider pinging us on Slack if you're thinking a new dependency might be needed.

# In src/python/pants/backend/url_handlers/s3/register.py we advise adding
# `botocore` to `[GLOBAL].plugins`, but `botocore` is particular about the
# version of urllib3 used.  To make the s3 handler easier to use, constrain
# urlib3 here.  Per the voluminous thread at
# https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/2926 this can likely be relaxed when
# Pants itself is on a newer version of Python
