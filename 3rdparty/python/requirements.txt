# Note: Adding a third-party dependency is usually frowned upon because it increases the time
# to install Pants.
# This is particularly painful for CI, where the installation of Pants is often slow.
# Additionally, it increases the surface area of Pants's supply chain for security.
# Consider pinging us on Slack if you're thinking a new dependency might be needed.
