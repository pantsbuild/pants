This directory contains the canonical ANTLR example files,
copied from http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Example.
We use these to test the python_antlr_library functionality in pants.
Ideally this would live under tests/antlr, but pants currently
doesn't support python_antlr_library targets there.
