Sense and Sensibility
=====================

*With some gratuitous markup*

No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of
announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house, and should
incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her ``inhabiting`` it.

They Heard Her With Surprise
----------------------------

Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband **civilly** hoped
that she would not be settled far from
`Norland <http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/wtw/search/controlservlet?PageId=Detail&DocId=102275>`_.

She had great satisfaction
--------------------------

...in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward
turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise
and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,

    Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to
    what part of it?

She explained the situation.
