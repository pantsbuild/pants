# Why does this page exist?

The page links to the
[[hello world README|pants('examples/src/java/org/pantsbuild/example/hello/main:readme')]],
thus demonstrating that links work.

Also links to
[[Circular|pants('testprojects/src/java/org/pantsbuild/testproject/page:circular')]],
showing that "link cycles" don't trigger circular-dependency errors.
