/testprojects/

Here you will find projects that were created to exercise Pants functionality.
These targets are referenced from pants test code in /tests/ and may reference
code under /examples.

None of these projects should be broken. Broken BUILD files should be tested in
unit tests.

Ideally, none of these projects would be referenced from documentation.
Example code intended for Pants users should be placed under /examples instead.
