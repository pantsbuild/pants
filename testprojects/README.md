/testprojects/

Here you will find projects that were created to exercise Pants functionality.
These targets are referenced from pants test code in /tests/ and may reference
code under /examples.

It is possible that some of these projects may be intentionally  broken to
create negative test cases or to demonstrate bugs in Pants.

Ideally, none of these projects would be referenced from documentation.
Example code intended for Pants users should be placed under /examples instead.
