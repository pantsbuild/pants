# When we do (dry-run) testing, we need to run the packaged pants.
# It doesn't have internal backend plugins so when we execute it
# at the repo build root, the root pants.ini will ask it load
# internal backend packages, which it doesn't have, and it'll fail.
# To solve that problem, we override pants.ini with an empty list of
# additional backends option.
