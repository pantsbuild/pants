Pants Code of Conduct
=====================

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
Pants community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We
are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and
expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of
conduct may be banned from contributing to the project or participating in
community discussion.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect
it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.


Our open source community strives to:

 * *Be friendly and patient.*
 * *Be welcoming:* We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to
   building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to
   treat everyone as fairly and equally as possible. We strive to be a
   community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and
   identities.
 * *Be considerate:* Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those outcomes into account when making
   decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be
   communicating in someone else’s primary language.
 * *Be respectful:* Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
   a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. On that note,
   whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take
   responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our
   responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to
   right the wrong.
 * *Be careful in the words that we choose:* we are a community of
   professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
   Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
   exclusionary behavior isn’t acceptable.
 * *Try to understand why we disagree:* Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
   disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that the strength
   of our community comes from different people have different perspectives on
   issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t
   mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming
   each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve
   issues and learning from mistakes.
 * *Be inclusive:* Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor
   diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity,
   language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion,
   sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not
   tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above,
   including participants with disabilities.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you have experienced or witnessed unacceptable behavior—or have any other
concerns—please report it by contacting us via pants-conduct@googlegroups.com.
All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

 * Your contact information.
 * Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
   are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
   occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
   available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a slack history), please
   include a link.
 * Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to
how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response
team, they are required to be excluded from handling your incident. If the
complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by
a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality
requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will endeavor to
make an alternative reporting chain available in the event you need to report a
project lead or a member of the response team. The members of the response team
can be found in [COMMITTERS.md](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/COMMITTERS.md#active-committers).
