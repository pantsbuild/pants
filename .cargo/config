# N.B. On OSX, we force weak linking by passing the param `-undefined dynamic_lookup` to
# the underlying linker used by cargo/rustc via RUSTFLAGS. This avoids "missing symbol"
# errors for Python symbols (e.g. `_PyImport_ImportModule`) at build time when bundling
# the CFFI C sources. The missing symbols will instead by dynamically resolved in the
# address space of the parent binary (e.g. `python`) at runtime - obviating a need to
# link to libpython.
