  # With Big Sur, MacOS changed its versioning scheme from 10.X to 11.X. A pantsbuild.pants
  # wheel built on Big Sur will declare its platform (in its name) as macosx_11_0. Unfortunately
  # pip does not yet recognize that as a compatible platform for Big Sur.
  # Fortunately, Big Sur may also be identified as 10.16, for backwards compatibility with the old
  # versioning scheme. Setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.16 when building the wheel will cause
  # that wheel to declare its platform as macosx_10_16, which pip will then happily install.
  # However, in order to build the wheel as macosx_10_16 we must also build the native code for
  # that platform string, hence this setting here.
